from the spicy brownie I wish I can use image but I'm so brained with tech that I look at source codes in regular scripts or whatever   
and I'm just lost there are two ways to answer this question the first Docker compose pull Docker compose up- D that isn't very helpful 
is it it's kind of like there's a club and everybody else is having fun but you're not allowed in it and every single time somebody says
to rtfm you want to read the manual but it doesn't make any sense or it tells you to do this and when you do this you get this it's not 
fun it feels like a club and you're not in it here at Futo software we believe that for any piece of software we give you a client like 
Google drive or iCloud or Google photos that we would have to give you access to the server software as well so you could self-host or  
self-manage your own instance what good is it for me to say here this piece of software is agpl go read the manual when realistically   
speaking 99% of the people who read it are not going to understand it I'm going to share with you the results of a 22-year journey that 
started when I bought Seuss Linux 8.1 in Best Buy for $80 from my 13th birthday to 2011 when I decided to self-host and self-manage my  
own business phone system after realizing that if I wanted visual voicemail with my voice over IP provider that would cost extra if I   
want call recording that costs extra if I want extensions that costs extra and realizing that it really does matter when I pay for a    
product or a service that I have access to the ability to host my own server this is something that I've been building for myself over a
very long period of time and it's something that I've never really seen documented all in one place packaged and put together in a      
manner in which normal people can understand it and I've tried to do that here I've tried to remember what it was like to be a beginner 
we' when these Concepts were very confusing to me when I would read a manual and I would do exactly what it said and nothing nothing    
would work which totally never happens with Linux documentation and create something that was actually usable for all of you I'm talking
about a system where if somebody walks by a camera in your my house I am alerted within seconds on my phone that they were there with a 
picture of them I'm talking about a system where when somebody calls my business phone system that business phone system will have a    
call or ID with the status of that customer's case or ticket so I know exactly what's going on with it before opening my web browser or 
picking up the phone a system where if a drive dies in my system I am emailed within one minute or less so that I can resolve the       
problem and have an immediate backup just like that a system where my emails on a self-managed self-hosted email system show up in every
Gmail Microsoft 365 and iCloud email inbox in the world even though that server is running in my closet and I receive mail without      
receiving the spam because I have working spam controls a system where I never see an advertisement on any of my devices even when I am 
using a device or a program where I don't have Adblock installed a system where I can watch 4K Blu-ray content that I ripped off of my  
own Blu-rays in spite of the fact that most modern drives only let you rep up to 1080p a system where I can search through all of my    
photos from 15 years to find the one video of a orange and white cat with black spots sitting on a chair and find it immediately amongst
a 100 terab array of things within less than 2 seconds the ability to synchronize my calendar and my contacts without using a Google    
server and the ability to have something that is as fast as Google Docs or Google Sheets or Google's PowerPoint look alike that loads f 
fast and just works a complete backup solution that is constantly backing up everything that is on my phone to my computer and anytime I
put something in any one of the directories on my computer that I specifically want to go to my phone instantly goes to my phone but    
only if I want it to end is backed up on a regular basis to the point where I literally have to run two commands if I screw anything up 
by user error or by drives dying and everything is back to the way it was before I broke it there are many ways to set this up there are
many different ways that you may want to set it up what I would like to do is just show show you one way to set it up that works that I 
know works because unlike many instruction manuals I didn't just write my manual I did every step in my manual from scratch to build a  
second server that does everything that my server does and then I wrote down exactly what I did as I did it I don't want you to watch   
this and think that this is the only way to do it or that it's the best way to do it or you have to do it this way that's hardly the    
case the fun of this entire thing is building your own thing from scratch it's like restoring a vintage car I'm not not here to tell you
exactly what parts to use what color what material you to use in the inside I'm just here to show you something really cool and hope    
that you'll be inspired to create something really cool as well because there's not much point to me be telling you well here's the code
host your own solution if none of you know how to do it I want to show you how to do it with that said let's answer your question on how
to install image answer a Docker compose pull Docker compose up- D answer number two well that's what the next 12 and a half hours are  
for make sure that you take a look at the written guide which will be included in the description down below to follow along with many  
of the commands the shell scripts and all the images that show you exactly what it is that I was doing as I went hey everybody how's it 
going hope you're having a lovely day here at Futo we are trying to Fund Solutions to Big Tech abuses and one of those big Tech abuses  
has to do with your photo library how many people here remember when smartphones came with micro SD card slots so that you could store  
all of your photos and videos and take it with you wherever you go how many people here remember that around the same time that Apple   
and Google started pushing their Cloud hosting solutions that cost money every month that almost every phone on the market lost their   
micro SD card slot and how many people here remember when I was talking about on my channel how Apple doesn't have a delete button and  
how Google has reported people to the police for being pedophiles of because they had photos in their Google Drive and Google photos of 
their wife breastfeeding their infants on these are the problems that come up when you don't own your software if you cannot review The 
Source Code of the software that you are using it's not yours if you don't have the ability to run your own server what you're paying   
for is not yours we would like to create software like this that does not abuse you that's easy to install that has Cloud Solutions just
like Apple and Google however anything we create with a Cloud solution must also be something that you can run on your server so you    
never have to worry about this image is one of those pieces of software that we believe is a solution to a big Tech abuse it's a piece  
of photo gallery software that works amazingly well and we'd like to create a Cloud solution so that people can just pay us 5 or 20     
bucks a month and never have to worry about it we're not quite there quite yet we are still at the stage where if you want to install   
this amazing piece of software you have to set up your own Linux server and use Docker and everything else and well that that's going to
be a little bit difficult so a lot of people have been asking me if I could show you how to do that and if you are not quite aware of   
why this software is awesome this is be using a local AI so this never has to connect to the internet if I don't want it to and it will 
still work look at how fast this is I'm going to hit enter my phone's battery is almost dead and it immediately finds every picture of a
cat on a chair these are not photos on my phone these are photos that are on a server in the other room and I'm going to show you       
exactly how to set this up because that's been a very common question that I've been getting in the comments how do I set this up well  
first I have to show you how to set up image but to set up image I got to show you the way that I usually get my files from my phone to 
my server and if I'm doing that well I'm connecting to my server from outside which means that I have to show you how to set a VPN      
tunnel because I'm not going to forward ports for all these random Services am I and if I'm going to do that then I have to show you how
to set up a Linux server and also how to set up a router with openvpn but garbage like this the stuff that you're going to get at       
Walmart for 30 bucks it has openvpn and it gets updates until you don't and you want your system to be secure right so if openvpn comes 
out with an update 3 years from now because there's some sort of zero day security risk you don't want to be dealing with a router where
they stopped updating the firmware six months in right so I have to show you how to make your own router and I'm going to show you how  
to make your own router I might as well show you how to block all ads even when you're connected to it from your phone and while I'm at 
it well I mean if we're doing all the stuff anyway I might as well show you how to set up something similar to Google Docs and how to   
have your calendar your contacts and all this other stuff this becomes a rabbit hole very quickly because there are so many items to    
cover and I'm not going to breadcrumb you I want to provide you with everything which means we have to start from the beginning this is 
not going to be a 10-minute video this will probably be a three or a six or a nine hour video and you'll get to figure out how much I   
hate you based on whether or not I provide you with timestamps so let's start at the very beginning with the router we are going to be  
building our own router now why are we building a router we are going to have all these different services like image home assistant    
nexcloud macal frig tons of different things that we are going to be running but I don't want to have the ports to each one of these    
Services open to the internet I don't want people to just be able to see that these services are all running on my server because that  
means that there's four or six or eight or 15 different points of failure I'd rather have one point of failure that's managed properly  
and that's what a VPN is for a VPN is a way for me to create a secure encrypted tunnel between my phone and my Home Server so that I can
connect into my home server and into my home network using one system image is great software frig is great software home assistant is  
great software but these pieces of software are used by 0.00001% of the population openvpn is something that is used by companies in the
S&P 500 it is used by governments openvpn is used by everybody the reason this is important is that if there is any security breach in  
in openvpn whatsoever somebody somewhere has found it and solved it because openvpn has tens of millions of eyes on it at any given     
moment which means that it is as hardened as it can be from security standpoint in contrast to more obscure software so rather than open
every single port on my router for all these different services so everybody can see them the only thing I want to open is for openvpn  
because this allows me to have an encrypted connection and it's also going to be incredibly secure and I want to be certain that I will 
always be able to update my router if I'm still using this thing 58 years from now I wouldn't be able to get the newest version of open 
vpm I don't want to deal with this Dollar Store [ __ ] where a year and a half from now I stopped getting foral updates it's it's       
insecure you can technically if you technically you can find routers out there where you can run your own software and there are people 
that make home brew stuff but I wanted something that runs in my own Hardware so that even if the Homebrew project sto making it I can  
install somebody else's project on it because it's based on an x86 architecture just like my computer so what I've chosen here is I am  
going to be using pfSense which is an open source firewall and I am going to be using an Intel Nook as the hardware I chose pfSense     
because many years ago it was very functional it was fast it was open source it got updates pretty quickly it worked it has PF blocker  
NG which is great for blocking ads um they've been they've been dicks in recent years with regards to this other project called OPN     
sense I don't really like that very much but I'm kind of grandfathered into using pfSense because I've set up my entire system in it I  
don't feel like migrating so it it's pretty good though it's just good software the devs are kind of and what I've chosen over here is  
an Intel Nu computer for the hardware and the reason that I'm using this is because this computer over here has two ethernet ports and I
cannot have a computer with one ethernet port if I want to have a router so I need to have this thing because this has both a Wan port  
and a lan Port that I'm going to be connecting my computers to so first things first is let's download the installation disc and get    
started by creating an installation disc and then booting up our computer and configuring it so that I can start this as a router so the
first thing we're going to do is we are going to go over to PF senses website s it we are going to download the image so that I can     
install it so you can just go over here to PFS sense.org if you forget the web name of the website just Google pfSense and you'll find  
it right here we're going to go to here we go products let's see buy now this is a free version somewhere here we go download download  
okay what the [ __ ] is this what what the [ __ ] is okay something stupid is going on here pfSense ISO requires an accountant buil are 
you [ __ ] kidding me go here okay here we go see my sticky this is a bunch of copy pasta the yeah the [ __ ] what I said about the     
developers of this software again it's great software great software um yeah the software is is great [ __ ] that they've yeah I don't  
get anyway back here okay so first thing we're going to do I'm going to download this link so what I did over here is I found this over 
here pfSense C mstick 2.7.2 release AMD 64. image. I prefer G here we go we're going to download it look at that my internet's actually 
not [ __ ] today nice Spectrum knows people are watching all right so we are going to type gzip DD this is going to unzip is it that we 
go okay here we go look at that we have our image file now the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to attach a flash drive I        
actually don't have a flash drive available but I have an NVM SSD which is the total way any USB stick will do for this job if you don't
an empty external hard drive is fine whatever drive you use just make sure you're okay with erasing it here I have a drive that I'm     
going to be plugging in via USB now here's something that I often do because I've I have a habit because I used to do data recovery from
my primary computer back at the old store before we had pc3000 and everything like that and I used to use Linux and be copying stuff    
around DD do all sorts of stuff like that so I always make sure that I'm not erasing the wrong drive because I've almost done that many 
times so I just like to type Fisk DL I can see all my drives and then when I plug in a new drive it will show up over there there so I  
can confirm that this is it and I'm not erasing one of my own drives in my computer cuz again I've done this many times so this over    
here is a 2 terab drive that I'm using to install a router operating system which is you know hysterical but dudo DD this is this makes 
me super user in Linux and DD copy [ __ ] if that's our source which is going to be our image of that's we're copying it to which is Dev
SDC and again if you are just if you're using l and doing this like I do I just recommend you unplug your USB drive type f-l again and  
make sure that whatever Drive you're about to move stuff to disappears if it doesn't disappear that means that you are about to         
overwrite your system drive or something else plugged into it and that will make you very sad um guess how I know so over here we do    
this and I'm going to type block size equals 4 megabytes and Status equals progress so I can see it as it goes so I can see it as it    
goes Zip Zip it's [Music] zip 40 megabytes per okay I'm using the USB one port on this piece it's a router operating system like I give 
a [ __ ] okay so now we have this so now I'm going to configure my Intel Nook uh to to work here so this is an Intel Nook that I got    
open box on eBay for about $150 and again you're going to want to have a computer with two ethernet ports now the reason I got this     
instead of any one of these other router PCS that you probably are wondering or asking about on Amazon so if I like search pfSense      
router over here one of the things that you'll notice is that you'll have some that are made by companies that are that you're aware of 
like again netgate this is I I would trust this they're a little bit on the expensive side but again I would trust it and then you have 
um hunon and no just just no you have a lot of these no name no idea who the hell makes this [ __ ] and the problem I have with all of  
this random stuff on Amazon is that you will see suuk and hunson and all this other random garbage show up along inside Microtech like  
this should be what's ranking at the top Microtech is one of the best brands of devices that you can buy when it comes to routers       
they're very very high quality materials and it's showing up next to all this random noname crap and I have no way of knowing if any of 
these reviews are trustworthy for several reasons the first is that Amazon has allowed vendors to have reviews for digital picture      
frames and shower materials apply to air conditioners and they were not changed even after it was reported by many people they have     
vendors that will bribe their customers to leave good reviews and and those vendors never get in trouble they have sold fuses that are  
10 amp fuses that were branded as 2 amp fuses they sell electrical crimps that don't Crim and recently they sold a litter box that      
killed a cat that was still showing up on their platform even after it made the news these may be great PCS but all I'm saying is that  
you're probably rolling the dice with buying them and with the amount of time and effort that we are going to be putting into doing this
in my opinion it's not worth it to roll the dice with stuff like this most of the people watching this video probably have some old     
desktop PC sitting around their house collecting d that they don't use anymore and a 10 or 12y old desktop PC in my opinion is going to 
be infinitely better than any of these the only problem is that your old desktop PC only has one ethernet port which is fine because    
even an older device is going to have PCI Express card slots and in my opinion you're much better off taking your old desktop computer  
and putting one of these inside of it or one of these inside of it then you are buying any of that random noname crap and the best part 
is expandability you put a fan in your computer and you put two of these and you've got 10 GB per second ethernet that's going to work  
very well inside of these routers if you look on PF sensus Forum they have great support where you can learn which network interface    
cards in which chipsets work with their devices these are two that I find to be pretty cool that's a dual Port one they make quad Port  
ones this is a 10 gbit per second one so it only has one port for 70 bucks you want to make sure that you buy from a reputable vendor   
because there are people out there selling counterfeit crap and you probably know which vendor I'm going to tell you not to buy from    
there the one thing that you got to be really really careful careful about here is uh is look at the pictures and really be sure that   
you know what you're getting because this thread of thread [ __ ] me up every time I'm sorry I can't help but laugh every time I see    
this I bought this Intel i350 thinking it was PCI Express what the [ __ ] is this connector and when you scroll down it says it's not   
PCI it's the joural I this deserves so many more than 14 up vades this is my favorite comment that I've ever read on Reddit standards   
are more what you call guidelines instant actual rules server world where standardization is a suggestion buying high-end network       
interface cards for a router and putting them in an old desktop PC in my opinion is infinitely better than buying one of those random   
no-name Chinese Mini PC [ __ ] just make sure that you buy something that fits your computer and not to short out and if I'm going to be
doing all this work I trust the Intel Nook more than I trust the hunen or the zch or the Z whatever I have enough videos on Amazon on my
channel if you'd like to find them so we're going to boot this thing up and and I'm going to set it up so that we can get started before
we can install pfSense on this computer we're going to have to disable something called secure boot many modern computers come          
pre-installed with Windows 10 or Windows 11 which are cancer and if you try to boot up into an operating system that's not cancer it'll 
give you an error because secure boot is enabled which does not allow you to boot into an operating system that doesn't suck so we are  
going to disable that so that we can actually install pfSense on this computer if you don't disable secure boot you will not be able to 
install another operating system on here properly so let's get started so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to plug in my    
USBC drive over here all right we plug it in turn it on I've got my flash drive and I'm going to spam F2 like mads that I get into the  
BIOS remember this was plugged into the computer before I turned it on just going to try and make life easy on ourselves here by setting
two options at once so I'm going to go to boot up there I'm going to go to first thing I'm going to do is secure boot we're just going  
to turn this off and then after that's done I'm going may be in a different place in your bios depending on the computer you're using   
boot priority I want to boot off of my USB drive first so the USB drive that I made is this little Rog Republic of Gamers Asus thing    
which I bought before I learned that they're a crap company and the next thing I'm going to boot off of after that is whatever the drive
that was first before so it's automatically going to boot up into my drive that I have over here first so it's going to reboot once I   
hit F10 and hit enter which is going to save my settings it should boot into the pfSense installation disc automatically if you didn't  
do that you could hit F12 or what F something or whatever the hell it is that yeah F10 I think F10 enter boot menu you could hit F10 t  
to the boot menu and then choose the USB drive device by itself but I like having it set to boot up into a USB device by default which  
is why I wanted to have the USB drive plugged in as I did that it's just a preference just a preference I'm also the type of person and 
I would wonder why it wasn't booting into the USB 50 times until I realized I forgot to plug it in I try try to work around my own      
idiocy okay okay we're going to hit accept any forced arbitration in there any forced arbitr I hope all right we're going to install so 
we're going to choose autog guided route on ZFS pfSense okay we're just going to name this pfSense actually I'm just going to overwrite 
what I already have on this drive I'm not going to encrypt not going to be using encryption for this we will encrypt our server though  
and so the defaults is f fine here default is okay now over here it's going to ask us which Drive do we install on so generic mass      
storage class is going to be the USB drive that you just plugged in the other one is going to be the internal drive you may have some   
sort of funky setup where you're installing onto a device with a USB as your driver something like that and if you do have some sort of 
funky setup you're on your own if you're installing this on a computer that has its own internal drive and you have plugged in a USB    
drive the way I have for this particular instance I am going to choose Micron because that's the internal solid state drive in this     
computer that I know the model of and again if you're using a USB external drive you you're going to just uncheck the first one because 
I don't want to use use the USB external drive here as as part of this so okay the last chance are you do you want to erase yes I do    
okay Zip Zip we're zipping the modern way it kind of reminds me of uh remember that episode of The Honeymooners where they got that     
little uh little carving thing they spent all their money on you like to reboot into the installed system now hi Miss Art Carney Jackie 
gleon joce Randolph Audrey Meadows what a good show what a good show all right so you're going to want to pay attention to the screen   
and the moment you have nothing on the screen anymore that's when you're going to unplug your drive because we don't want to boot back  
up into this again but it also don't want to corrupt anything by unplugging it too soon see you don't want to unplug it too soon but you
don't want to keep it plugged in too long rule of life right there it's going to boot it's going to have a lot of stuff that you        
probably don't get but I totally understand it all of course course let's do a basic review of what your home network looks like and how
we're going to be changing it before I go into configuring pfSense before I'm going to set everything up inside the router we have to   
plug everything in your home network probably looks something like this 99% of the home networks in America have a cable modem where you
have a coaxial cable coming in from outside that plugs into your cable modem and then that's going to plug into a router over here the  
reason that we have a modem and a router is because the cable modem has one port on it you may have a cable modem for this you may have 
a DSL modem where you plug in your phone jack into your modem you may have a fiber optic connection where there's a fiber connection    
going to your modem you have a modem the modem is going to take the internet from out there and turn it into something that you could   
use with your computer by plugging your computer in over here however this allows you to use one computer that sucks you're not creating
a local network you're having one computer attached to it so if you want to have multiple devices attached to it this is what a router  
is for over here so you used to actually have to buy a router separately back in the day but now they give you one with your internet   
service provider which is pretty cool so this is a router this is your standard Walmart piece of ship it has the blue Port which is the 
wide area Network Port that's the outside world it's got the orange ports that's the local area network that's all your computers your  
PlayStation your your TV your your desktop your file server everything else so you would plug this into your home Dev device this device
over here is not simply a router it's actually three devices in one a router is simply a device that takes your outside Network and     
allows it to talk to your inside Network a router pretty much manages traffic between two separate networks that's it you don't actually
have to have all this stuff over here for it to be a router you could just have literally just one port for outside one port for inside 
and you also don't have to have the antennas a router doesn't necessarily need to be Wireless so the device that we have over here that 
we're going to be using as a router is only one of these three devices cuz a router is a router a switch which gives us multiple ports  
and a wireless access point which is a switch but a switch that allows us to connect wirelessly so this over here has two ethernet ports
which means this is just a router one port is going to go to our cable modem like so and the other Port is going to have to go to a     
switch unless you want to only have one computer attached to this so you again you you can buy switches that are 52 ports that allow you
to power cameras and then you can also buy cheap little pieces of [ __ ] like this at a yard sale for five bucks this is honestly going 
to be totally fine for our purposes over here so this is what I would be plugging all my computers into so you get one Wan Port wide    
area network that's the outside that goes into your modem and you have the local area network which is going to be plugging into your   
switch which you can plug all of your computers into again this is the type of cheap piece of [ __ ] that you can probably find on eBay 
for five or 10 bucks but I'm not going to go into all the different types of switches here you can do your own research this is probably
fine for most people over here and dir cheap now you may Wonder there's two ports on here how do I tell which Port I plug the modem into
and which Port I plug the local area network into and for that you're going to make that decision probably the same way that I make most
of my business life and relationship decisions not really it's like a 50/50 chance like YOLO it's not this is not labeled so yeah 50/50 
you'll probably be fine all right let's plug everything in and move on to the next step which is setting up PF sense so the way I'm     
going to do this and the way you can do this if you don't have a switch yet is I'm going to plug one of these ports into my computer    
that I'm using to set everything up because at this point in time I don't need more than one port and I'm going to plug the other Port  
into my modem so that we can get started with this we're going to boot this firewall back up now just because I didn't feel like sitting
on the floor in my bedroom I plugged the cable modem with a long Ethernet cord into the left ethernet port and I plugged my desktop     
computer that I'm recording this video on into the right ethernet port so it's booting up right now here we go now I want you to pay    
attention while everything's scrolling over here because you're going to see a hint and this is a hint that's very important so the     
first thing you see is he where it says should vlans be set up now and it's asking yes or no it's asking yes or no should vlans be set  
up now and before you have a chance to actually hit yes or no you see all this other stuff show up in front of it now if you're new to  
this you may believe well oh my God I missed something up I missed my chance no you didn't you can still easily hit end to this right   
now it just put all this other stuff in front of it because like I put this none of this open source stuff was meant for normal humans  
to be able to understand it this was never taken into consideration while developing it it's not you it's not you you're not an idiot so
you can hit n over here what is a VLAN a VLAN is if you have one switch with 52 ports and you have a router and you want to have one    
cable between your router and your switch but you want to have five different networks on it they're all segmented that's that's way too
advanced and outside of what we're doing here so you're going to click no now what I was saying about paying attention it says on the   
bottom over here it says right over here we have an IP address 70 whatever the hell over here on interface emo this is you have 3/3 of  
the screen this is in the third third of the screen over here valid interfaces are igb 0 and em0 those are our interfaces those are our 
ethernet ports on the computer this way you you don't have to roll the dice anymore and guess so this says that we've gotten an IP      
address on emo and I am using Spectrum internet which does make me depressed therefore emo so this actually does make complete sense so 
the reason I'm saying to pay attention to that is because later on instead of rolling dice we now know which interface is which which is
awesome so going Hit N because I don't want to do vlans enter the when interface and we are going to input emo because I am sad because 
I use Spectrum enter the Lan interface that's going to be our internal Network that's going to be igb Z and these names are going to be 
different on your device every device is different versions of pfSense different Hardware is going to have different names don't worry  
if it's not exactly what you see over here the interfaces will be assigned as follows yes there we go it is going to configure          
everything here and remember the lanport is plugged into my desktop computer and the WAN Port is plugged into my modem okay now here at 
this point you're done you can you never have to look at this again you can put your keyboard and mouse away unplug the monitor from    
your pfSense computer and you can log in into the PF set's computer using a desktop you never have to see this again I'm going to be    
changing one thing you don't need to change this I'm only doing this because I have a custom setup so feel free to skip to the next     
section I'll include a timestamp Down Below over here it says you can connect on 192.168.1.1 where it says Lan in the bottom third of   
the screen and it has your IPS the WAN address that's your IP address that your internet service provider gave you in Lan that is going 
to be the IP address that you connect to that that's your gateway address that's the router itself so if you have 1 192.168.1.1 that    
means that every single device that you attach to this thing is going to be 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 and so on and so forth I actually   
have multiple networks at home so this will not work for me this will conflict with it so I'm going to change this but you don't need to
change this this is just extra something that I have to do from my own network to work I'm going to change that from 192.168.1.1 to     
192.168 5.1 so set interface IP address I'm choosing Lan configure via DHCP no enter the new Lan address 1921 168.5 do1 enter new land  
subnet account we're going to do this [Music] 24 for a land print enter for none configure IPv6 address via DHCP I don't even use DHCP  
so I don't really care let's see do wait no correct that I don't use IPv6 so I don't actually care I do use DH so DHCP we want what is  
the start address well if the Gateway is 1921 168.5 do1 that means we have everything from two onwards so this is the start and be we're
going to have the end right over there I don't need to revert to http no no point for that please wait while the CH changes are saved   
beautiful again this is not a part that you need to do I'm only doing that because of my own weird ass setup and here you will never be 
logging into this again unless something breaks so you can unplug the HDMI port you can get rid of your keyboard and mouse that you have
plugged into it and get that off your desk and we are now going to go over to the desktop computer that's plugged into the lanport you  
might want to just reset the internet connection on that particular device with whatever operating system you have however you do and   
it's also a good idea to reset the cable modem when you do this you know turning your modem on and off again fixes 99% of your problems 
in life especially if it was plugged into another router previously so I'm going to go over here to my screen and when I go to 1 192.168
5.1 it says warning potential security risk ahead that's because I don't have an I don't have a a certificate here because I just got   
this thing I just set it up so it's obviously it's not going to have a certificate nobody is trying to steal my stuff nobody's taking   
your password your email or your credit card you'll be fine you'll be fine you'll be fine maybe I should put maybe I should have a Ula  
clause or forced arbitration before I say that anyway here you go so usually uh the username is going to be admin and the password by   
default is going to be pfSense now obviously going to warn you over here that your password is still set to an insecure value we are    
going to fix that so hit next this is another thing so if you are using this in an Enterprise environment one of the nice things about  
PF sense is if you want to pay them money to get answers to your questions you can pay them to get answers to your questions I've never 
used it before and I hope the support is better than the download page on their website and I definitely hope that they're more polite  
to the paying customers than they are to the OPN sense people but again that's for another video so host name it's going to be this you 
you really don't have to now this stuff uh we're going to change this later right now I'm going to put Google DNS but we're not going to
use Google DNS later I'm just using this to demonstrate a point we're going to change that back later and override DNS means that you   
can have the DNS overridden by I don't know whatever your your uh the ones that your ISP provides and again we're going to turn that off
later as well so my time zone I am going to put that I am in Texas what we have us here we go us Central this over here like you don't  
have to edit this stuff most this next this is again what we set up already next admin password I am going to set it to something very  
secure here yes most secure password on Earth reload we're just finishing everything up here again if you want to pay them you can pay  
them okay like where ah beautiful all right accept and here we are we're on the latest version so this is going to be a page that just  
gives you the stats you could see everything that you that you have over here it's nice so you could see the interfaces that are up all 
right at this point before moving on we're just going to make sure that we can get online and that everything actually works so let's   
see beautiful all right we're on the internet next up we're going to set up Dynamic DNS Dynamic DNS allows us to know what the IP       
address is of our Home Server anywhere so if I'm creating a professional website I'm going to get a server that has a static IP a static
IP means that that IP is going to stay the same so if I set up rossan group.com on 1.11.1 I can set it up so that rossan group.com links
to 1.11.1 and I'm good however if I'm setting up a Home Server sorry I got this really nice uh wax candle thing here accented thing     
these things are amazing anyway if I have a Home Server I'm using Spectrum internet or AT&T or Verizon and on the residential plans you 
don't get a static IP you get an IP address that changes every single day so what are you going to do there you're going to check your  
IP address every single day and if it changes while you're out you're going to have to call your girlfriend at home and say honey can   
you go to what is my ip.com and tell me the numberers so that I can connect to my calendar server like that doesn't work so what we're  
going to do is we're going to set up something called Dynamic DNS Dynamic DNS is where the router is going to connect to a DNS server   
and tell it constantly if the IP address changes Lewis's Home Server is no longer 1.11.1 Lewis's hom server.com is now 1.12.1 so that   
you in your phone can set it up to connect to Lewis's Home Server rather than have to worry about the IP address changing all the time  
now there are many services that allow you to do this and one of my favorite is free DNS you can go to Freed dnsaf ra.org and you can   
add a subdomain like I'm going to do over here so I could click add and after I click add I can fill in whatever I want over here it's  
actually a pretty funny website I I genuinely enjoy this website I like this website it's filled with lots of silly little funny memes  
you have to pay extra if you want want to get the cool domain names if you don't you get these ones so let's say I do ls's Lewis Home   
Server it's going be lsom server. Chien killer.com and I'm going to set this up as an a record now one of the things that I'm going to  
do on purpose is I'm going to give it a wrong IP address and the reason I'm going to give it the wrong IP address is because I want to  
see if my system is actually working if I set that to what my IP is right now then how do I know if anything that I'm doing has actually
work once you're done you will see this on the screen you'll have your subdomain over there and what you're going to want to do now is  
going to go over to Dynamic DNS on the side and after you go to Dynamic DNS you can scroll all the way and you'll see your domain name  
right here and once you see your domain name which is going to be Lewis homes server. chicken killer.com you are going to go over here  
and rightclick direct URL and this is going to be what we are going to use to tell pfSense to update this on a regular basis so after   
you do that you're going to go over to pfSense where are we here here here's my PF sense we're going to go over to Services Dynamic DNS 
where you're going to add one now this is going to be a little counterintuitive the way I do it so just pay attention we're not going to
use free DNS here as the service even though that's technically what we use we're actually going to set that to custom Force ipv4 DNS   
resolution check that we're not using the username and password everything we're going to use an update URL so everything that you see  
here after this question mark that's kind of like your password your username and pretty much everything this over here is like an API I
key it's just going to tell free DNS everything that they need to know so once you do that you can uh you can save it over here we're   
just going to put a description free DNS IP update we click save over here once you're done it's going to give you your IP address over 
here and if this is working the way it's supposed to when we go back to free DNS you should see when you go to your subdomains it should
have that IP over here so again I I'm I'm deleting most of this because I don't but since this updated lsom server. chicken killer.com  
is now this IP I know the Dynamic DNS is working because I purposely put the wrong IP in to begin with and now I know that this is set  
up the way it's supposed to be so anytime I'm going to connect to my home server I can now go to lsom server. chicken killer.com rather 
than having to save the IP now I have something that is easy to remember so rather than having to remember a number or check that number
every single day I have something that is stable this is going to update very often so if your IP changes this is going to change before
you've noticed it which is great welcome I'm Lewis from the future I was editing this video and didn't realize that Mr Clinton walked   
over my keyboard because I wasn't paying attention to him the night I was talking about openvpn as a result that video Never recorded   
and I was talking into the void let's re explain what openvpn is openvpn is a service that allows me to Tunnel into my home network with
an encrypted connection there are many benefits to this anytime that you are opening ports on your router you are exposing Services     
behind your router which is a security risk you cannot guarantee 100% % security but what we're trying to do here is we are trying to   
increase security at each point that we can and we are trying to mitigate risks I'm going to show you how to use a bunch of different   
programs mail servers contact servers note server the ability to log into your thermostats and change the temperature in your house if  
you want to an hour before you get home image servers file servers and each one of these has their own individual point of failure      
further since these are small open- Source projects they don't have a lot of eyes on them and that means that you have a higher risk of 
there being some sort a security breach if you open these ports to the public further when you open these ports to the public that means
that anybody that gets your IP address or is scanning random IPS can now know here are all the services you're running because they are 
exposed to the public openvpn stops that because we only have one service that's open to the public and they need to be able to breach  
that before they can see everything else the best way that I can describe it is like this running image and frig and nexcloud and       
everything else on your home server is like having all of these different doors to your house if you open the ports for all of these    
different Services it's a door but somebody can kick through that door pretty easily and further they can see exactly which Services    
you're running and they can see anything that's going on in your home because this is your window and if they do manage to um to kick   
through the door well this is the person watching it on the other end with small open- Source projects you only have a small number of  
people that are going to be looking in trying to figure out the security flaws in them because the projects I'm showing you w amazing   
projects they have user bases that are measured in the thousands maybe hundreds of thousands if they're lucky whereas openvpn is a door 
like this good luck kicking through that door and you can't see inside so here even if you haven't kicked through the door well you can 
see what anybody's doing inside the house here you can't see [ __ ] the only thing you could see is that this open VPN running but      
that's it and if they do kick through that door well here's what's waiting for them on the other side the people coming through the code
they're this not this this with that said let's configure and set up open VPN there are certain small settings that if you get these    
things wrong you'll wind up with crap where like it connects for five or 10 minute increments and disconnects or stuff just doesn't work
right or you won't be able to get the benefits of the ad blocking I'm showing you later so if you are Advanced as a network             
administrator engineer you probably shouldn't be watching this video anyway but if you're a newbie watch very closely to ensure that you
set things up exactly as I am here so that your setup doesn't wind up with any of those aggravating aggravating things so you'll read on
forums all the time like my VPN works for 5 or 10 minutes after I configured it or set it up and then it dies and stuff like that or you
know I set up PF blocker NG on my router but it's not blocking ads on my phone so just pay attention each step of the way now I will    
return to uh to lwis of the past who uh yeah for anybody wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses I have three powerful 25 wad LED bulbs in 
my ceiling fan that illuminate the room amazingly well in spite of that if I don't have Studio Lighting on I look like this these are   
very bright studio lights and if I stare at these studio lights while also staring into a screen after 10 p.m. my circadian rhythms will
be destroyed and I will never fall asleep so I get to choose between wearing sunglasses or well being invisible I kind of like my       
sunglasses they're pretty nice so what we need to do is we need to install openvpn so that we can have a nice secure encrypted remote   
tunnel into our Network where our server is going to be so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to install a package that   
makes it much easier to do everything that we're looking to do over here and that package is going to be called openvpn client export so
go over to system we're going to go over to package manager available packages and scroll down to neck is killing me scroll down to     
openvpn client export this is going to make it a lot easier for us to create the files we need to make so that we can get everything    
working on our Android phone iPhone or laptop later regardless of the operating system we're using it just makes the process of getting 
the files you need for open vpn's client to work just massively easier and it takes a few seconds to click next up we go to system and  
we are going to create a certificate authority to be clear here we're not creating a certificate we're in authorities so just think of  
it remind yourself of a it's a Frank Sad Cat Diaries the authorities have left me here to die my food B is empty also watch the Frank   
Sad Cat Diaries anything where the Frank is teaching you about animals it's exceptional so descriptive name we're going to call this    
openvpn certificate Authority next we're going to change key type over here let's make it a little bit bigger so you can see it we going
to change the key tpe that makes type to 4096 digest algorithm change this to Shaw 512 common name openvpn internal CA hey country code 
you don't really have to fill this stuff out there's no point in that like you know where where you live and where your server is so I  
don't really care about that that much next we're going to make a certificate for our server so this is the certificate that is already 
there for our uh for the web goey that I logged in we're not using that here we're not touching that descriptive name openvpn server SE 
name it something that you are going to remember later certificate Authority open VPN certificate get Authority make sure it's what we  
just chose RSA again we're going to match this 4096 digest algorithm Shaw 512 common name use whatever you put into your into your      
Dynamic DNS earlier that's what I like to put here so lsom server. chicken Killer really chicken killer I guess if if the shoe fits man 
if the shoe fits unfortunately chicken killer.com oh chicken killer.com going to use this later again for all this stuff over here I    
don't really care I know where I live certificate type remember this is an important one because it's very easy to miss this change     
certificate type to server certificate not user certificate server certificate and for alternative names usually I'll just put in my the
the domain name that I chose for my Dynamic DNS again make sure everything I chose is correct cuz it's late and I'm Delirious hit save  
great next up we're going to create a user and a user certificate so go to user manager we are going to go to groups first and we're    
going to add a user group for VPN users so VPN users VPN users there's no nothing really crazy to configure here just put that in group 
name and description next go over to users we're going to create a user over here VPN user password I'm going to make it the most secure
password on Earth which is five numbers in a row please use a secure password for yourself when you're doing this for the love of God   
use a secure password and you want to if you're going to be somebody who doesn't remember what this is on your phone you can use a      
secure password manager like bitw to remember it and this is going to be a member of VPN users very important click here to create a    
user certificate open VPN and VPN user user seert for openvpn certificate Authority has to be the same one that we used for creating the
openvpn server certificate openvpn certificate authority over here again we're going to set our key type RSA 4096 length digest         
algorithm Shaw 512 that's got to be the same throughout everything here and hit save once you're done with this now we're ready to go   
and create our VPN all right so let's set up the VPN Mr Clinton started clawing on the door and let me know that it was enough filming  
for the day also it is daytime again but I I don't want to look at studio lights I don't know what to say I kind of got spoiled so the  
old the sunglasses I really can't stand looking at studio lights anymore so when we go to VPN up here go open VPN VPN open VPN go to    
wizards type of server local user access next certificate Authority openvpn certificate Authority that's the one we made next           
certificate goey default very bad do not use this that is the certificate that we were using when we were that was the default one      
that's made when you uh make pfSense for the first time this is for logging into the web interface we don't want to use the one we use  
for loging into the web interface we want to use the server certificate we made so remember when we made a certificate named it server  
certificate that now we're going to set up the settings over here so separate openvpn server that works for me as my name now for local 
Port I don't want to use 1194 I'm going to use 1195 because I already have an openvpn server running on my network because I already    
have a network so you can keep it at 1150 94 there's no problem with 1194 I'm changing it because I have something else in my network   
already so DH parameter length over here make that Ure that is 4096 that is over here when we scroll down to data encryption algorithms 
I'm going to choose aes256 and Cha chaa poly 1305 and this is the uh and the as 128 but I like to have the 256 GCM over 128 GCM have a  
fallback data encryption one use the CBC one just in case uh Auto digest have that Shaw 512 Hardware crypto since I'm using a Nook Intel
Rd Rand engine now ipv4 tunnel Network this is important this is going to be the range of ips that we're using for uh for the VPN       
clients so if here I'm going to switch over to dhtp server for a moment so when you log into my router remember I'm logging into 192.168
5.1 that's the Gateway but then everybody else who is connecting to my router on the Lan is getting an IP somewhere in here so this is  
the range of ips for people who are connecting to my landan and this is the same thing they're asking over here they're asking for what 
this what is going to be the addresses for people who connect to the VPN so I'm just going to make this 192.168 60/24 so this means     
people who connect to the VPN are going to be 1 192.168 6.2 3 4 5 and so on and so forth continue on allow communication between clients
connected to the server I don't really have a need to check or uncheck this because usually I'm going to be the only client connected to
the server and the clients connecting to the server are going to want to connect to the server they're not going to want to connect to  
each other so I I leave that unchecked now for DNS server this is very important you're going to use our pfSense router IP the entire   
point of this is to have the benefit of PF blocker NG of adguard DNS and all of that so we want that to be there also it is a good idea 
to have a fallback just in case something goes wrong so the adguard DNS that you had you it's a good idea to put those over here just in
case something goes wrong I still want to use pfSense as my DNS server because pfSense as my DNS server is going to have both adg guard 
DNS and all the benefits of PF block R but I'm going to do is I'm going to take those two adguard DNS servers from before and I'm going 
to put that as DNS server number two and DNS server number three but it's still going to prioritize DNS server number one which is my   
pfSense router now we're going to add a rule to permit connections to this VPN server instance from and clients anywhere on the internet
remember the point of having openvpn is that I could Connect into my system from outside my my home network so that not having a        
firewall rule that allows this to happen it really just kind of it defeats the purpose and a r for allow all traffic from connect the   
clients to pass through tunnel yes finish now there's a few options that I'm going to be changing just a few little things over here so 
let's scroll through this is all right this is all correct correct correct now make sure this is checked force all client generated     
traffic through the tunnel for IP pv4 I don't want the traffic to be going to the normal Network for any area I don't want there to be  
any leaks I want to be going through here I want everything to be encrypted through my tunnel and I want to avoid seeing ads anywhere so
make sure everything goes to the tunnel excuse me sorry now for custom options there's a few things I'm going to put in here that just  
if you're using a smartphone with a spotty connection this stuff makes it a little bit easier for me to not have to worry about crappy  
service or random disconnects and stuff like that and this over here is going to make sure that we are using the DNS that I want on you 
that I've had experiences in the past where clients were kind of not wanting to use my DNS you must use my DNS now for Gateway creation 
change this from both to ipv4 just just trust me on this one this will save aggravation later okay I'm just going to review my          
connections and make sure that I did not miss anything that's important [Music] here and also for Server mode SSL TLS plus user off     
means in addition to having a certificate to connect to the server your are also going to have a username and a password and later on we
may even do some two Factor authentication just to go crazy with it for fun now hit save take a moment to save now after it saves go to 
client export this is what's going to make it easier this is what we installed before so this is our VPN server now for host name over  
here you're going to put in your Dynamic DNS UR URL that you got or the the name essentially the name of your website over here so this 
is what is going to point to my home IP address I want to put that here so that every time I connect to my VPN instead of having to type
in the IP address manually I have the IP address automatically attached to lsom server. chicken killer.com I actually have my fishy in  
the upper right corner of the screen and I was looking at my fishy because they're cute they are really cute I love my fishy okay after 
this scroll U scroll down now you should hit save as default on the host name have to change the host name and then now openvpn clients 
this is the user that you created remember that so you're going to hit click Android and it's going to download a file now once you have
that file you're going to put it on your phone so let's take that file sure I have this download it again there we go okay I'm going to 
take that file and I'm going to put it on my phone now the real fun begins so I'm going to grab that file that I just sent myself I'm   
going to open it with openvpn going to import the profile my username VPN user I'm going to save my password for now my ultra secure    
password of 1 2 3 45 for the love of God use a real secure password don't do this don't don't use my password use a real password       
password okay disconnect VPN I also forgot that I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi so let's disconnect from that because that defeats the   
purpose here okay yeah so I just disconnected from my home wifi so I'm only on 5G okay profiles go settings down here advanced settings 
go and change this from Legacy to prefer word and DNS fallback use Google DNS as a fallback no no no no no no okay next up we are going 
to come up with a comprehensive solution for blocking advertisements at the router level why do we want to block at the router level    
number of different reasons first of which is obviously Simplicity rather than having to have ad blocking on every single device of ours
we can have it on one device but more importantly it's that advertisements cannot get through to areas that we can't add block by       
traditional means and when I install Firefox or Brave or any other browser you bet your ass it's going to be loaded up with you block   
origin Brave Shields canvas blocker no script I'm never seeing an advertisement on my web browser but what about devices we attach to   
our Network where we cannot install an app blocker what if I install an application on my Android phone that has advertisements inside  
of the application I don't have a way to Adblock that what if I have a smart TV and it's trying to serve me advertisements I can't      
install ad block on my television but what I can control is the internet connectivity that that device has and I can control the device 
that allows it to connect to the internet and as long as I can control my router I can control the advertisements that show up in my    
device if I have an Android application on my phone and it's trying to contact googleadservices.com what if my router just says no what 
if it just says weed we're not going to load that we are not my router is not going to be a common carrier with net neutrality my router
is not neutral my router says Fu advertisements because it is biased that's what I want I want a nice biased router that says Fu to     
advertisements and there are two different ways that we're going to do this the first is through IP address blocking and the second is  
through domain name blocking what is a domain name a domain name is simply the name of a website rosang group.com google.com            
googleadservices.com your computer has no idea what rosan group.com is it has no clue what google.com is what it does is it asks a      
server what is google.com and then the server will say say google.com is 33.33 similar to a phone book you can't go to your phone back  
in the day and type in Lewis Rossman you're not going to be able to call me you had to go to the white pages and then you would find the
name Lewis Rossman and then next to it use the phone number 34755 22258 now what we're doing here is we are going to block based on both
we are going to block the names of websites that are known to be filled with ads but we're also going to block the IP addresses of them 
as well the reason we need to block both is because domain names and IP addresses can change so let's say that there's an ad server     
that's filled with garbage at 1.11.1 and that is googleadservices.com googleadservices.com points to 1.11.1 now what if Google changes  
that to Google marketing services.com links to 1.11.1 if I'm only listing names of websites that are known to be advertisements I'm     
going to miss that I'm going to start seeing ads again so I want to block the IP addresses as well but what if I block 1.11.1 and now   
Google has it changed because I know there was a storm where and they had to move data centers what if googleadservices.com now goes to 
1.11.2 if I'm only blocking IP addresses and not domain names I'm going to start seeing ads again so you want to block both so we are   
going to use a program called PF blocker NG that helps us block both it is going to use a list of feeds that it's that you subscribe to 
you can control the feeds you subscribe to you can control the frequency that you update these feeds and these feeds will be blocked so 
any device that's connecting to your router that is using your router's DNS will will no longer be able to see uh any of of these ad    
feeds and if you are connecting to this router at all the IP address is that it blocks you're not going to see first thing I want to do 
before I get to anything else is I want to see what my Baseline is before I actually install any of the stuff or set it up I don't want 
to use a web browser that like my normal one that has all this ad blocking stuff built into it because then I'm not going to be able to 
tell of what I did actually did anything so we are going to start out with stock Google Chrome with no extensions installed at all and  
go from there so I'm going to do a couple of quick tests God knows that Google is not going to give me a web browser by default that    
blocks ads something tells me that's not how this works the first thing I'm going to do is use D3 WS ad block tester and then there's a 
DNS leak web T website web TI website that is going to show me what DNS server I'm using so we get an idea of where we started out so on
ad block-t . 38 points out of 100 when I go to D3 Ward for ad block testing it says I've blocked six out of 135 which is pathetic and I 
am using my home device for DNS so the DNS resolver within pfSense is what's working so that's our Baseline now that we know what our   
Baseline is let's install something from scratch so what we're going to do is we're going to install a package called PF blocker NG PF  
blocker NG is going to be a package that sits on the router this is going to do a lovely job of getting rid rid of a lot of junky ads so
let's get started with this we're going to configure it and I'll be honest the interface of this is not exactly the best but it is free 
and it works so you kind of get what you pay for so we go to PF block we go to firewall PF block reny once it's done installing and this
is what it looks like it's enabled over there by default so I'm going to open up all the different tabs that you get over here and we're
going to look through them together so first IP blocking this is is enabled now you want to make sure for the outbound rules that it's  
blocking both Lan and openvpn remember we want everybody that connects to this to be able to get the benefits of the IP blocking that we
that blocking the service like when I when I attach my phone to this I don't want to see ads either so make sure that you're blocking   
the openvpn interface as well that should be set up by default these are the lists that you start with for DNS block here it's going to 
be Unbound mode so it's going to be using my DNS resolver DNS groups these are the ones that are already working this is going to be    
what everything resolves to so when you go to googleadservices.com instead of it going to Google ad server instead of it going to 1.2.2 
do2 where that's the IP address of Google's ad server it's going to serve it this which is going to be bunk and again over here permit  
firewall rules make sure that you choose both your Lan and your openvpn interface over there when you get to feeds this is this is a    
little bit intimidating so you have this which is telling you what it is we're blocking so this is the IP address feeds and then on the 
bottom those are the uh website name fees for for DNS blocking so this would be like blocking googleadservices.com and up here would be 
blocking you know 2.1.1 one and stuff like that and when you have feed website over here you can click to see who it is if you want to  
know who's like get an idea of what that Community is like and then this is the list itself so if you want to see stop Forum spam you   
can look at their forum get an idea of how they operate who they are figure out if you trust them or not and over here it's going to    
give you the actual list so all we really need to do here in the beginning is click like crazy and add a bunch of new feeds because     
that's going to be fun now these ones with the checkbox over there it means that you've already got them this when you see a checkbox in
the left this is going to be for a group so for instance when you have this blue check boox up here it means that all the stuff in this 
group pr1 PR i1 pr1 blah blah blah that's already blue checked so these are going to be the individual feeds and then this is going to  
be the the entire group so I'm going to go and add a bunch more as you can see there's already a lot of stuff here I don't want to add  
tour like I I don't hate tour there's no reason for me to block tour I'm not going to block torrent IPS because like why why would you  
block torren trackers that's like that's like the people that dust pornhub.com like they provide you with free porn and and you dust    
them and like why right so this is AWS I don't want to block that this is public DNS servers no need to block any of that we're already 
blocking a good amount of stuff see email I do not want to block email servers I I have nothing against email servers but I would like  
to block malicious so I'm going to open that in a new tab with my middle Mouse button fishing I have no love for fishing malware no love
for malware malicious I'll take a little bit of that it's like shopping at HB all these suspicious stuff over here that's kind of that's
already added trackers and a bunch of other stuff so now we're going to go to each of them HCK enable all and then make sure for the DNS
block lists it is set to action Unbound and for the IP lists make sure it's set to deny both so this one requires an API key I have you 
have to pay for that which is why that one is off over here click enable all save oh API key I'm not saying it's not worth paying for   
these lists but I'm not going to go down all of them and figure out which ones are worth paying for right now so this one enable all    
action Unbound if you enable all the list but you set a you have actions still set to disabled you're you're not getting any benefit    
line 16 API key is not defined I'll delete that one there we go and we can go back to feeds and I'm I'm just going to double check      
through and see that I've got a bunch of stuff selected [Music] so let's see what these things are for scanners stop Forum spam binary  
defense what is this yeah I'm not gonna do I don't want to block tour okay these are spam ones domains so I am happy to block a bunch of
email spam no love for email spam now once I'm done with all that I want to go to update select Force option update run reload option is
going to be all and we're going to download as much of these as humanly possible it's going to take a few minutes no big deal I will see
you in the future our update to our feeds has finished and been reloaded so I'm going to go back to Google Chrome and I'm going to      
remove all the cash cookies anything like that and we are going to see the score that we get now so let's go back and add block test and
see how they do so you remember how bad our score was before right 32 or 38 on this thing we get a 78 now and on D E3 Ward we blocked I 
think six or eight and oh my god wow 119 blocked nice very nice now the third thing we can do in just in case we want some insurance    
here is we can stop using the standard DNS servers that get used here and we can force it to use adguard DNS adguard DNS is like a phone
book that just rejects [ __ ] so you you can't get which is beautiful so I'm going to go and change our DNS over to adguard DNS and see 
I'm going to show you how to do that so we're going to find our adguard DNS servers at adguard ddns doio we're going to go to routers   
configure our DNS manually and it's going to give us IP addresses of router servers which is nice so you just click and you copy them   
now you have two you have non-filtering and this we want the adg guards ones that block ads and trackers so you can copy those go back  
to PF blocker go system General setup allow DNS server list to be overridden by dhap PPP or when remote server no I don't want to use my
isp's DNS I want to use mine so we are going to add those DNS servers over here let's add the each one by by Google DNS bye-bye am I is 
that NSYNC or Backstreet Boys why something something something byy bye bye I'll go over to Services DNS resolver in DNS resolver when I
click enable forwarding mode I'm going to click save and then I'm going to reload the service once that's done it's going to zip the    
Modern Way all right the DNS resolver configuration is been changed the changes must be applied for them to take effect apply changes   
you have DNS forwarding mode on then we're going to reload our service and we're going to make sure that it is running so status        
services beautiful it is running now we're going to open up Chrome dnsleaktest.com we're going to check the standard test and as you can
see it shows that we are using adguard DNS so we successfully changed our DNS server over the reason I checked this at the beginning and
also at the end is to make sure that we didn't mess anything up in the process next up we're going to check out some ad blockers again  
and see how we perform 131 blocked so our test result is better and over here we get 78 points out of 100 this is beautiful now I'm     
going to log into the VPN from a smartphone and we are going to see if it's possible to have all the same ad blocking benefits on the   
phone we're going to do the same little before and after test and I'm also going to to make sure that the router is accessible so that I
know that the VPN is working so the first thing I have to do is I have to hold my phone far away from my microphone because the 5G in my
phone is giving my microphone covid it was making a lot of noises before that that's a joke by the way for people watching on Rumble so 
let's search over here for D3 Ward D3 W add blocker this is me just connected to standard smartphone internet there's a lot of red over 
here so as you can see yeah 17 blocked 118 not blocked new tab add block tester 38 points out of 100 and now let's see whose DNS I'm    
using here so DNS leak test extended test this is T-Mobile's DNS next up I'm going to attach to my VPN after attaching to my VPN let's  
clear everything here browsing data cookies cash all that stuff DNS I'm going to go there from scratch make sure that I'm not using     
t-mob anymore this also make sure that my VPN is properly passing over DNS and all the all the good stuff that so it shows my home IP   
address so I am logged into the VPN that's a good thing notice how the server found is stuck at one right now so that means that most   
likely I am getting different results which is great beautiful ad guard DNS next up let's go over to our ad blocking tabs over here     
retest look at all that green oh that's gorgeous 131 blocked this is stock Google Chrome no extensions 78 out of 100 so all of the ad   
blocking benefit from the router is now achievable through any device that I attach to my network which means any application on this   
phone that is that is running that wants to access those advertising servers can't if it's on those lists now let's make sure I can     
access my router before we move forward it is critical crucial Essential by the way and aside I want to make a written version of this  
guide there's the right way to do it where I write it and the lazy way to do it where I take my transcript of this video and feed it to 
chat GPT you'll know whether I did it the former way or the latter way based on how many times you see crucial and essential and it just
keep that in mind so it is crucial and essential chat gpt's favorite words over there to make sure that I can attach to my home router  
over here even when I'm not attached to my home network because this means that my VPN is working and it's allowing me to access local  
services and as you can see it is so this means that we can move on to the next step we can start now that we have a proper base which  
is a functioning router functioning VPN server that does everything it's supposed to and functioning AB block and we also don't have any
issues where it's randomly disconnecting every five minutes or any of that nonsense here's the fun part next up we're going to be       
installing an operating system onto our server Hardware that we're going to be using as a server when I say server you don't have toy   
buy anything fancy a server can be anything at one point I was using a 10-year-old laptop as a server and here I'm going to be using a  
almost 10-year-old desktop that I I just put into this case that got left at the store as a server it is an older computer and it's     
going to have two solid stay drives in it that we are going to use in raid one so I put two drives in here I'm going to be putting in   
raid one I'd suggest that just as a base setup it's not these drives are dirt cheap nowadays the point of raid is not to have a backup  
raid one is where each Drive is going to be a mirror of the other so if one drive dies it's still going to continue running off of the  
other that in and of itself is not a backup solution however it is just one tool that we are going to use as part of an overall backup  
solution that I'll be going over later the reason raid is not a backup is because one when one of the drives dies if you got two drives 
of the same brand at the same time when one dies the other one's probably going to go with it the second is that a lot of the times     
people don't check because raid one works so well where when one Drive dies the other one just keeps chugging along and working         
perfectly you are not going to know that the first drive died until the second drive also dies and the whole thing is dead but there's  
going to be a plan that we have to mitigate that and we're going to go over that at the end of the video for now all you need to know   
find yourself an old computer put two drives in it preferably ssds so that this will work fast and let's get started so I'm going to be 
using Ubuntu Linux for this the reason I'm going to be using Ubuntu instead of other distributions is because I imagine if you're       
watching this video you are probably probably closer to the Newbie part of the spectrum than the the advanced expert part of the        
spectrum if you boot into a gentu Linux terminal or an Arch Linux terminal using their install disc and you just see a command prompt   
and like you're supposed to bootstrap your own operating system on your own have fun that's that that's that's a lot of extra work in my
opinion for very little benefit if you're an newbie I use Arch Linux and I used to use gentu for 12 years because I enjoy pain I want my
life to be more difficult than it has to be whether it's my personal relationships my life my career or my home operating systems and   
server I like pain but I am not going to impart that preference onto you because that should not be your preference we're going to be   
using Ubuntu for a number of different reasons it's insanely easy it's got a lot of great documentation there's a giant Community out   
there of people that'll help you with all the stuff it's being used as a server by many other people and if you use the LTS release     
you're getting a bunch of software that's pretty much made to work together if I'm using Arch Linux I love Arch I get bleeding edge     
software packages all the time bleeding edge is not exactly what I'm looking for when I want a server I want something that's dependable
that works Works where somebody else kind of curated the packages that are going into it so with that being said first thing we're going
to do is we're going to go over to their website and let's go over to products we're going to go to ubuntu.com go products Ubuntu Server
download Ubuntu server and we click download over here you want to make sure that you're downloading the LTS version you want to        
download the this is going to be the stable one you don't want to download the one with the latest newest greatest software you want to 
download The Proven Works LTS one so after that take your drive and we're going to plug it in so this this is where I'm I'm a little bit
crazy just because I've had problems before where I've done something very careless and stupid so I'm going to do f dis- l it shows me  
the drives in my machine now after I do that I'm going to plug in my flash drive I do it again I see the new one SDC Dev SDC that's how 
so this is the drive I just plugged in now just because you know not saying I speak from personal experience or anything I've to I've   
never accidentally deleted somebody else's data or mine I unplug the drive again SDC is gone I plug it back in SDC is there that's      
another great thing about raid one for your operating system by the way if you accidentally DD over your operating system drive you have
two back to this so now what I'm going to do is we are going to use DD to take that image file I just downloaded so DD if equals        
downloads folder Ubuntu Server ISO there we go of equals Dev SDC block size equals 4 megabytes status equals progress I think I got the 
ask command wrong but we'll see now that says it's copying at 1 Gigabyte a second which is there's no way in hell with what I paid for  
that drive I also think I made a mistake and I may have my front us B ports on my computer might still be USB 2 if that's the case I    
will edit out the uh the amount of time it's taking to copy this because it it'll be insanely slow and that would suck to sit through I 
have a feeling that I that that's it's working at usb2 speed oh kind a su let's see h just going to wait for it to finish have the      
Jeopardy music playing in my head right now anybody remember that Honeymooners episode can it core an apple it's zip it's zipping the   
Modern Way amazing [Music] fast it is ha Dam I am [Music] F Jackie gleon Art Carney true Talent anyway as you could see over here it    
copied at 24 megabytes per second so it was indeed his zipping the modern way with USB 2 because I I I I [ __ ] up when I built this    
computer so now that that's done we G to take our Ubuntu Linux server Drive plug it in here and boot come on turn on you can do it you  
can do it all right so we're going to do here is we go to boot menu I'm going to spam F12 the the key is going to be different on       
whatever computer you're using cuz they all have just you're going to have to hit whatever key is necessary for you to boot into a      
different Drive D than this default now let's take a look at what I have on this computer so I have fish grub that is likely this SSD   
from my fish computer that I stole for this video that's an SSD that I plugged in 250 gig not what not it Windows boot manager          
definitely ain't it ufi Samsung flash drive that's what I plugged in that that's it uh it's 250 GB Samsung Evo not it that's my SSD     
that's also my SSD enter setup that's non boot so the two options that make sense are Samsung flash drive and UA non UEFI Samsung flash 
drive I want to use UEFI Samsung flash drive if it's a modern computer and we're going to click this or hit enter on that and we're     
going to boot up into Ubuntu Server so try or install Ubuntu server we're almost there so I'm going to choose English going to hit done 
okay now for buntu Server I'm not going to install the minimalized one I'll install yeah let's see I'll install normal one search for   
third party drivers I am not Richard stalman so I just want my computer to work I will I will take I will take some proprietary stuff if
it means my computer works I don't want to code my own kernel drivers here okay now for Network this is going to be very important so I 
have two interfaces here that you can see I don't need both interfaces that's completely unnecessary I'm but let's just focus on the one
that's plugged in most likely your computer that you'll use as a server only has one ethernet port so you won't have to even think about
which one to choose the one that I obviously I'm going to configure is the one that is trying to get in address so this one Auto config 
failed this one dhcpv4 it already has tried to grab an IP address so that's the one that my cable is plugged into now what is DHCP DHCP 
means that this is going to grab an IP address from my router automatically when it connects to it now you want this if you're if you're
just setting up any just random computer in your house if you have a laptop connecting to Wi-Fi you don't want to have to manually      
specify an IP every time you log in that's lame you but with a server environment I want this IP to stay the way it is I do not want it 
to be dynamic this a d and DHCP I want it to be static meaning the IP stays the same so what we're going to do here is we are going to  
set it up so that it stays the same but before we set it up so it stays the same let's just go back to our router setup so we can I can 
give you a bit of an idea of how you would set this up so when you are in your pfSense router go Services DHCP server this here is a    
subnet what 1 192.168 5.0 /24 means this means everything within 1 192.168 5.1 to 1 192.168 5. 254 that's what this is so this is an    
abbreviation for this so really just pay attention to this so when we set this up 192.168 5.1 is my router's Gateway so that IP address 
is taken up by my router because when I'm logging into my router I'm going to 1 192.168 5.1 now over here you'll notice that my address 
pool range is is from15 to 245 which means that 246 through 254 are available and it also means that from2 to 14 are available the      
reason that is set up this way is because I want there to be a buffer of ips that I have for servers and everything else that I connect 
so I don't I don't want there to be any sort of conflict where somebody plugs their computer in while my computer is rebooting and      
they've stolen my IP or any any of that kind of horseshit so what I'm going to do over here is I'm going to choose an IP address between
1 192.168 5.2 to 192.168 5.14 for my servers and then just to make sure that if somebody else is deciding to use a static IP and they   
think that they're going to be sneaky and they're going to take the IP of my server while it's rebooting we're going to create what's   
called a static mapping to ensure that this is the only computer that can have that IP so to be clear on average everyday people when   
they plug an ethernet port into your switch what they are doing is they it's automatically going to grab an IP add address from that    
router based on whatever the router wants to assign it based on this range a static IP means it's going to ask for a very specific IP   
and if that IP is available it gets it if that IP is not available sucks the suck you're not going online so we're going to set a static
IP so we always know what the IP is and then we're going to set up what's called the static mapping to ensure this is the only computer 
that can get that IP to ensure that it's always available all right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click here go edit ipv4     
you're going to change that from DHCP to manual now subnet over here remember subnet is going to be the same thing that we saw in       
pfSense over here so when you scroll down DHCP subnet is going to be this and then the IP is going to be whatever I choose manually so  
back here subnet 1 192.168 5.24 and address 1 192.168 do 5.2 Gateway that's going to be my PF sensor router so you're going to type in  
the whatever the IP address is of your router that you're using to log in when you log in a pfSense which for me is going to be 5.1 now 
name server very important your name server is going to be the DNS server and you want that to be the pfSense router 2168 5.1 save okay 
now make that full screen so I can see everything again and hit done I'm not going to be using axy to connect to the Internet it's      
testing the mirror once that's done we are going to hit done and set up our drives now don't use an entire disc we're not using that I  
want to set up raid one and I want it to be encrypted on the OS drive you would think that with how easy Ubuntu is that this would be   
intuitive but Ubuntu somehow managed to come up with a way to actually make this more difficult than using gentu and doing this from the
Comm Man line I'm not kidding so watch this this is in like I'm going to be eating my words on Ubuntu being easy for beginners so if I  
want to set up raid one uh even the deian installer is easier than this watch this so first thing I need to do is I'm going to go to    
each one of my Samsung ssds that I plugged in Samsung SSD over there and Samsung SSD over here these are going to be formatted and      
erased these are just drives that I grabbed from old Linux backups that I don't need anymore so erase and where it says Samsung flash   
drive fit that's our installer dis we're not touching that pretend that that doesn't exist so the first thing we're going to do with    
each one you're going to click on each drive and go use as boot device click on the drive add as another boot device once that's done   
you'll see on the bottom that there is an EFI partition that is prepared that's going to be mounted at boot slfi that is 1 Gigabyte that
is insane you do not need a 1 Gigabyte boot partition so we're going to edit this over to 512 megabytes and on the bottom over here we  
are also going to edit the one that it created on the other SSD to 512 megabytes uh so 512m 512m next we're going to create another     
partition for the boot partition and again this this is where this is counterintuitive if you want to use rate you would think I'm just 
going to create Mount SL boot they made it easy from no no no no they didn't no no no you're going to go here and you're going to go    
leave unmounted we're going to and we are also not going to format it either so one G and we're going to do that for each drive so we   
did that for dve the first SSD I'm going to do it for the second SSD one gigabyte boot partition uh leave unformatted I put a lowercase 
G up there I actually don't remember if that matters in the abun to installer but okay now after we do that we are going to create a    
software raid out of those partitions so partition two on here and partition two over here and I'm going to call that boot raid one     
that'll be mine so that that's done that's where I'm booting from remember partition two on each of the Samsung drives boot raid one    
create now we have free space left on each Drive 231 gigs because these are both 250 gig drives we're going to create a partition that's
going to be our root partition again we're not going to format it yet because that's a troll we are going to leave it unformatted and   
then we are going to make a partition on the other one and also leave that unformatted and note since I want to use the rest of the     
space in the drive I'm not filling in any space in size over here now we're going to create another software raid and we're going to    
call this OS Drive raid one because our OS is going there now you can name it whatever you want I mean I have silly names for things so 
we are going to make this is again make sure that raid level is going to be mirrored it defaulted to raid one I should have said        
something but raid level mirror just because it is defaulting to raid one for me does not mean in the next version it will all right    
great now on the bottom it was showing you the partitions you made on your drives that that are used up here you're going to see the uh 
the raids that we made over here right so md/ boot raid so we have this and this had we're going to format this as our boot drive now   
now we format it so we going to go up there remember boot raid that I just made we're going to enter format ext4 Mount boot done now the
next one for a root this we're going to use to create we're going to create a volume group on this this is going to have a volume group 
created on it with lvm now here's the fun part lvm let's see I'm going to call it Ubuntu install now where are we installing it I have  
no idea remember what I said about the LTS releases being the ones that are oh this is bug tested it's all stable yeah so look at this  
so you literally can't see the device so this is 231 gigs this is 2.57 gigs that's 27 gigs and I I don't I have no idea which is which  
this is actually a bug that's supposed to be in the beta version and this is not the beta version anymore but that bug is still there   
I'm actually curious why it is it showing me 2.6 GB because I know that I have the flash drive which is 26 my EFI partitions which are  
each 512 my boot raid which is going the boot rate is 1 Gigabyte because it's raid one and then I have the 232 gigabytes for my yeah for
my Linux man it's it's it's it's Linux like it is what it is it's you get I I'm getting what I pay for here I'm just going to double    
check that my yeah let's just make sure that this was striped yeah it says one for both okay that's good so we're going to guess here   
this is what we call YOLO remember what I was talking about with rolling the dice before with figuring out which ethernet port it is    
we're going to YOLO we're going to roll the dice so create volume group I'm going to call it ubun to install and for device I'm I'm     
using the scientific method here of clicking each and seeing what the sizes are so the 231 GB one is the one for me now create encrypted
volume so here I am going to create an encrypted volume uh choose a password here that you'll remember put it in a password manager if  
you have to don't use 1 2 3 4 the whole point of encrypting is so that if your computer gets stolen out of your house when they boot it 
up even if they've stolen your computer they're not going to get access to your data like PE the type of people that need to break into 
your house to steal your server are not the type of people people that are going to break into this like unless you're getting your your
door beat down by the CIA or the NSA or something but for the most part you don't have to worry about people breaking into this make    
sure that you're creating an encrypted volume this is very very important here we're not encrypting Boot and we're not encrypting boot  
fi but we are encrypting this you can create a recovery key if you want I'm not creating a recovery key here that's a personal          
preference thing I will remember my password from now until the end of time okay now that I've created my logical volume group I am now 
going to create a logical volume on it Ubuntu and we're going to call this Ubuntu root the size is going to be the max I'm going to     
mount this as Boot and format it as ext4 so if we go to the top over here you'll see we have our root 231 gigs boot 1 gig and boot slfi 
which is the 512 megabytes this booty fi is on the part each partition one of dis one and two boot is on the software raid that we      
created and root over here is on the logical volume manager encrypted which is also sitting on my software raid that is a mouthful right
there so we can hit done continue only continue if you know that you have nothing on those drives that matters think about it think     
about it continue okay my name Lewis my server's name Happy Cloud yes username Lewis password the most secure password on planet Earth  
done I'm going to skip Ubuntu Pro for now install open SSH server yes because we do want to be able to SSH into this the I mean if you  
want you could use it with a monitor and and a keyboard and all that but I want to be able to remote into this so that I can set it up  
without having to be right in front of it all the time done no applicable third party drivers are available okay so that's great I'm    
stallman inst stallman compatible now over here I'm not going to install any extra Stu it is installing and we're going to let it       
install Zip Zip zipping the Modern Way really need a better desk for this I did not drink through the desk environment at all all right 
now we are ready to reboot and enter our server environment let's see if it reboots if it does we're good if it doesn't we screwed      
something up horribly so I am going to unplug the USB only once it reboots once it's done turning off I don't want to mess anything up  
here failed on mounting CD ROM it's because I don't have one who has a CD ROM drive in their computer anymore I do have a Pioneer bdr   
2213 in my computer upstairs you probably know what that's for I'll give it a minute to finish unmounting when I see it start to boot up
again I will unplug my USB unless it never does m actually here we go let's see it boot up look at you you're booting okay now it's     
going to ask us to type in our password to unlock our disk if we forget this password no data from this point onwards you forget that   
password and if you didn't make a key your data is gone you will you will not get that until Quantum Computing becomes mainstream hope I
live that long now notice that it grabbed an IP of 1 192.168 5.2 since that's been done now would be a good time to make sure while     
everything's booting up that we set up our static IP mapping that I talked about earlier so let's go ahead and do that so what we're    
going to do is I'm going to go over to PF sense and I'm going to go to status and then I'm going Diagnostics actually and I am going to 
go to ARP table in ARP table I will see the MAC address of everything that is hooked up here 192.168 5.2 is this computer so I'm going  
to click on this copy that is the MAC address that is the interface of this particular computer Compu everything else over here is for  
some other stuff that I set up in order for this to work and function alongside of my other router because I have another router since I
have two setups in my home now we have 19216 5.2 we've taken our Mac address we are going to go and create What's called the static     
mapping so go Services DHCP server let's discuss ISC DHCP a key DHCP and why this matters what are these things it's an excellent       
question DHCP is going to be how your clients are connecting to your router are they getting an IP address that your router is assigning
to them or are they getting IP addresses manually our clients are getting them manually and they are registering with host names but one
of the things that I like about ISC dhtp that is not in Kia DHCP it is something that pfSense is going to constantly spam you about is  
that it has this special option when you go to the DNS resolver so when I go services and DNS resolver I have these two check boxes over
here and one of them says register DHCP leases in the DNS resolver and the other one says register DHCP static mappings in the DNS      
resolver what this does is it allows me to take those static mappings that I made when you go to Services DHCP server and static        
mappings and it allows me to use these to go in my web browser or in my terminal and find that actual machine so when you go down here  
you'll see uh DHCP static mappings and I have host name Android stuff now what you do is you take that host name and when you go to     
system in general setup you combine it with the domain name so if our host name is Android stuff and the domain name that you see over  
here is home. arpa I could type Android stuff. home. arpa in my browser and it will take me to 192.168 5.5 this is a really really cool 
feature and I like that feature it means that instead of having to remember IP addresses I can simply remember the names of the machines
and this is a great thing and this is something that is missing from the key at DHCP version that you are going to constantly be spammed
about when you are trying to use this particular router or firewall now when you go to networking you're going to notice it says this   
ISC DHCP has reached end of life and will be removed from all future version of pfSense that's fine I understand it Kia DHCP is the     
newer modern DHCP distribution from ISC again I understand that that includes the most requested features and this is where the Linux   
system comes in cuz here's the thing when you switch over to Kia DHCP I want you to tell me if you notice anything different over here  
most requested features my balls you go to services and DNS resolver and what happened to register DHCP static mappings and leases in   
the DNS resolver it's gone so guess what is going to happen if I try to use my host names there and you you can probably guess what I'm 
going with this it's going to constantly ask you to switch now I am been using pfSense for so long that my own setup I like I I started 
with ISC DHCP before there was even a warning about it but TCP ISC DHCP DNS resolver register static if you just do a very very quick uh
search over here you'll find this on the netgate Forum and this is what I have to say again when it comes to the I love the software but
the thing I said about the developers early in the video is this this is an an interesting one so this person is looking for this very  
very important feature that apparently is not among the features they consider to be important features and when you scroll down over   
here you will get one of these responses from again in my my opinion your your standard Linux form bag of dicks key is stable and       
functionality well documented merely lacking subjectively expected features doesn't make it unstable and no registering DHCP leases into
a local Zone file is not a critical function of a DHCP server in fact it's not even a thing outside the context of pfSense AKA I know   
you had this feature in older versions of your router where you could use your host name like Android stuff. home. arpa and that would  
allow you to visit that computer but now in this new version of this DHCP server that is no longer going to be there and we didn't even 
think that it was necessary for us to alert you of that before constantly spamming you to change over to this new service that is going 
to [ __ ] up your entire home network this is why people who write Linux documentation are the bane of my existence they are evil they  
are not good people and they will [ __ ] with your mind and Gaslight the [ __ ] out of you if you let them it's false no way not this   
time we created it not this time no not this time it's totally made up pure Fiction it's fiction it's fiction we made it up we made this
one up it's a madeup tale it's a total fabrication it never happened it never happened this one was invented by a writer not this time  
it never happened it's false it never happened it's a fake it's Fiction it's an urban legend that never happened no way we got you not a
chance not this time it never happened it never happened we made this one up it's fiction we made up this one we made it up not this    
time wrong not this time not this time you're wrong not this time it never happened never let them it is not you that is crazy because  
every single day your router asked you please please for the love of God switch to this new thing and then when you switch to the new   
thing the stuff that worked before just doesn't work now is that a necessary feature of a DHCP server no no it is not you are correct   
Internet man is it a feature that I care about if my network has been using this for almost 10 years and now you've just taken it away  
from me yes it is there is absolutely nothing wrong with saying that this is deprecated we didn't make this thing this is the new thing 
that's available you got to use this and here's what's missing but that's not the way it was written the way this was written is it says
it says most requested features are there there is not even a footnote saying that that is missing that is going to be very very        
annoying if you are somebody who has been using using the software for 10 years is setting up a new installation and can't figure out   
for the life of them why this thing that always worked before that was pretty damn cool and useful doesn't work now it's just like it   
worked you took it away from people it's something that's really really important and it's not in the documents be careful those Linux  
people on those forums because again it ain't you that's crazy it's them so I would suggest that you stick with ISC DHCP until this     
stuff is configured because I like my DHCP static mappings showing up so that if I set up a static mapping I can just go Android stuff. 
home. arpa and it just works I don't like the fact that I have to reconfigure my entire network to use IP addresses or manually register
every single one of those in the zns resolver myself because somebody else thought it was not imperative that they tell me this about my
router when they're taking away that feature from me something to keep in mind if you decide to use Kia DHCP instead of ISC DHCP but I'm
not salty now we're going to scroll to the bottom add static mapping now we're going to paste the MAC address that is a unique address  
that represents the network interface card that I pluged the Ethernet plug into on my server and the IP address is going to be what we  
set the static IP to 192.168 5.2 can set it to we're going to have happy let's see Happy Cloud Server static IP this is already going   
and you know to use the gate this Gateway as default so we hit save changes must be applied now what this means is that if somebody     
plugs in their device into my network Wi-Fi or with a plug and they try to take the IP address of 1 192.168 5.2 my router is going to   
check and it's going to say is this your Mac address and if that's not its Mac address then it's going to say screw you that IP address 
is reserved now yeah you could spoof a mac address and stuff like that but when I'm doing this I'm not doing this this is not something 
that's being done for security this is something that's being done from my own carelessness if I accidentally tried to boot up another  
device that just so happened to have a static IP that I forgot I set to the same static IP as this so that that doesn't happen this is  
not being done so that if somebody breaks into my house they can't log in you know Mac address spoof or anything like that you can spoof
a mac address this is not a security thing this is really just a carelessness thing so that to to kind of get around my own natural     
inclination towards being careless so now that that's done let's get started with setting up Ubuntu Server the way that we need it to be
so that we can use it for all of our fun purposes next up we're going to configure networking you may wonder what are we talking about  
why are we configuring networking again if we have already done that during the installation we created a static IP we created a static 
mapping so something else can take it I thought we were done we're done for this server but we're not running one server we're actually 
going to run multiple servers within this server the reason that we're going to be using virtual machines to run multiple servers within
a server is because it makes things easy when something screws up let's say that I have free PBX and home assistant and macow and       
nexcloud and image and frig all installed on this device that's a lot of stuff now let's say I just hose one of them let's say I just   
destroy my next Cloud instance completely and let's say I can't figure out how to fix it well I may want to roll back to an to a backup 
that I had from yesterday or a week ago now rolling back to an update from a week ago for next Cloud I'm probably going to curse a      
little bit but whatever if I don't have a separate virtualized instance for these things that means that when I screw something up for  
nextcloud and I roll back to my weak old backup I'm getting a weak old backup of frig and nexcloud and home assistant and mailcow and   
image and free PBX and everything else I don't want to do that if I screw up free PBX I want to be able to take my back back up image of
free PBX and restore it without messing with everything else that's what virtualization is going to do now you may ask why are you not  
using Docker for everything because I'm a boomer that wears sunglasses in a room filled with light I'm not I'm not a sisman I'm just the
guy that wants to get away from Google and Apple so this is how we're going to do it now that means that we have five or six different  
virtualize servers however this computer has one ethernet port so how does that work how does a virtualized server that is not real how 
does the Pinocchio of servers connect to my router if there's no place to plug in a CAT 5 cable that is where we get into Bridge        
interfaces and we're going to set up a bridge interface right now so every one of those virtual machines thinks it has a network card   
and thinks it's connecting directly to my router which is what I want so first thing we're going to do over here is we are going to SSH 
into my server this is going to be fun all right so in order to ssh in we're going to go s S Lewis that's my username at the IP address 
of the server now when you first SSH and it's going to give you this error the authenticity of this host can't be established why is it 
saying that because I'm connecting to it for the first time this may seem annoying but this is very important let's say that somebody   
were to steal my server right let's just say somebody was to walk in and steal my server and replace it with theirs when I wasn't home  
and they had the same username and the password from my user on it they were trying to be tricky and I go to log into it it's saving    
this that key fingerprint is going to be saved on this computer and it's going to remember the next time I try to connect to the server 
and it's going to check to see that that's the same and if this changes it's going to warn me that somebody's screwed with me and stole 
my server now I know that I have nothing to worry about right now because my server has been right next to me this entire time and      
frankly if somebody managed to steal that server and swap it out while I was in the process of of doing this video they deserve all my  
data anyway you know good job but so this is that and we're going to log in with the username and password that I had before so let's   
see what the current networking configuration is before you mess with anything so this is going to be using net plan this version of    
auntu server uses net plan so we're going to go to the E net plan directory over here and you're not going to be able to see anything in
this directory if the permissions are set up right let's just make sure that okay let's see can I see that file excellent permission    
denied that's exactly what I wanted so we are going to use pseudo to be a super user and we're going to take a look at the configuration
of that file so cat this I'm going to enter my password again Pudo allows me to be a super user and this is the networking configuration
that we have this is now I'm going to want to save some elements of this network configuration over here because it's going to be very  
useful later so we are first things first is it says over here that even if I edit this file it's not going to save across installation 
so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take this ecloud thing over here and then we need to put net yes we need to         
essentially do what it says and insert Network config disabled in that file so let's do that now so sudo Nano W for I'm going to select 
Network config disabled paste it in there all right now we don't have to worry about that part anymore cloud in it is not going to      
overwrite my netpla settings upon reboot next up we are going to create a new file that is going to have I'm just going to copy and     
paste this information into a text editor so that I remember it I personally hate yaml files because they are this these these things   
drive me insane because if if there's even one space that's off the entire thing doesn't work and there's so many times where I've      
copied and pasted this especially if for frig it into a text editor at least with the early versions and change one small thing and I   
counted all the spaces and it still didn't work it drives me insane so I'm just going to save an exact version of that file as it is    
right now and now we are going to create a new one hopefully Mr Clinton doesn't bang on my door again he's kind of an [ __ ] but he's a 
cute [ __ ] but he he wants attention all the time I haven't been paying attention much to Mr Clinton since I started doing this I kind 
of feel bad about it all right we're going to make a new file now yaml files are difficult like don't mess with yo files they'll destroy
you so I I was tried to be nice over here and I put a nice little comment for how many space on each line so this is our original       
Hardware interface eno1 BR is the bridge interface remember we don't want to connect automatically we want to connect with the static IP
this is the address that we were grabbing before that's our name server that's the DNS so that you know you know ads server.com resolves
to nothing instead of ads server.com and the route is going to be our pfSense router and this is the hardware interface that BR which is
our fake bridge interface is going to be using contrl X save now now net plan will complain if we don't give the files in that directory
nice non-permissive permissions we don't want other people reading and writing and all that stuff and it'll it'll bother you if you     
don't do that and also I'm going to move I forget the name of the other oh there we go yeah I'm still say this that's going to get moved
to home Lewis just in case I don't want I don't I don't want to to lose that file just in case I screwed something up I'm going do that 
just to make sure could actually just type DS because I was in the home directory it's kind of silly but so let's continue so we're     
going to apply our configuration net plan apply yay it worked or it did it okay I don't need sud what's wrong with me okay Bridge       
interface I can obviously I can ping my Gateway let's see if I can ping Google's DNS server let's see if I have working DNS oh that's   
just lovely the fun part that you cannot forget and you have to promise you will not forget this part is you need to add the IP tables  
rules if you don't add IP tables rules this will all be for not because all traffic will be blocked and nothing will work when you start
your virtual machines so you need to make some IP tables rules for your Bridge interface so forward one ibrow tables I forward one now  
you have to make sure that these rules continue to exist after you reboot because if you just do that it's not going to do anything     
you'll wind up with it not working after reboot guess who forgot that when he rebooted his server six months ago and wasted an hour of  
his life trying to figure out why it didn't work not me you going install IP tables persistent so do you want to save your current rules
yes yes and there we go now we're going to reboot our server to make sure that this worked before we start installing virtual machines  
next up let's install everything that we need in order to install those virtual machines now you can set up virtual machines with       
something called ver using the terminal you do not need a guey for this however the guey makes it a little bit easier the graphical user
interface and there are ways to install graphical user interfaces on here that are not going to really clog up your computer the way    
that installing KD or gnome would do so so I'm going to install something called virtual machine manager which is going to make it very 
easy to use vers if you're new to all this and install our virtual machines you can always remove the guey later I feel kind of dirty   
putting guey on a server but it it's going to make things a lot easier for people who are new to this to be able to understand          
everything going on so that hopefully you'll be able to be more comfortable using the terminal for that stuff later first thing is make 
sure that the system is nice and up to date so the the colon over here says uh after the first command is done run the second one uh if 
you have if you put an end end there then it'll only do the second command if the first one doesn't give you some stupid failure this   
little col means even if the First Command failed do the second one and I'll be able to see if the First Command failed because I'm     
right here this update and all right so there is some stuff that here we go for some reason I thought that it did this when you         
installed it from the the flash drive some Linux dros will update everything over the Internet just in case your installation disc has  
older software some others don't no big deal no big deal not the end of the world not the end of the world the dash y at the end means  
instead of me having to click y to everything it just does it itself and I don't think anything here is going to be something that      
causes me to object for I do not want to install that piece of software so I just put the dash y you're so close 99% Zip Zip it's       
zipping the Modern Way okay first thing we're going to do is we're going to install a very very lightweight desktop manager now when I  
have two packages like I have two things like this what I'm telling it is to install two things at the same time so it's going to       
install you know it's going to install both of them and also this is this gorgeous I love that the fact that there's no dependencies I  
started using Linux so long ago I used this back when you actually had to care if you installed one package but that package had 50     
dependencies you had to install each one of those dependencies and then for each one of those dependencies those would have dependencies
and man there are kids today that don't even remember growing up when that was the when that was a thing my God [ __ ] that nice        
birthday nice protein shake next up we're going to install next org but I'm going to install it this is for the goey with the bare      
minimum stuff that I need so I don't want to install a bunch of other packages I really just want to install the the bare minimum stuff 
that I need all right now we're going to install all the stuff that we need to to run my virtual machines so vert manager is going to be
for that's my guey for managing the virtual machines that's for running virtual machines excuse me it's going to install all the        
dependencies it's beautiful lovely good little server who's a good little server you're a good little server nice little server yes okay
now we're going to enable my stuff that I need for the virtual machines this means it's going to start on boot and this is going to tell
it to start it right now so the first start on boot this begin now this is not going to work technically it allow me to configure       
everything as my user I need to add myself to a user group that allows me to do this so that's what this is going to do user add would  
add a new user user mod changes stuff about an existing user we're going to add ourselves to a few groups and my username is Lewis just 
in case you forget your username by the way you could always if you want to be a real nerd here you could do that instead of add LS I   
could add user all right next up we are going to start the guey so if you want if I wanted to I could install something that allows me  
to remotely like what SSH is to terminal to something called VNC for guey I'm again I I just don't plan on using the this the guey very 
long so I'm not going to install that I just I feel like if I tell you to install VNC that you will you will lean on the guey a little  
too much and we can't have that so we're not going to install VNC all right and go over here and let's start X so you log in with your  
username and your password I spelled my own name wrong I am an idiot let's try that again this is one this is openbox this is the most  
minimalistic gooey that you will ever see in your life now the way this works you're going to click your desktop with the right Mouse   
button and that's your start menu and these are your applications so the one we're going to be working with is when you click on the    
desktop you know applications you're going to go system virtual machine manager and this is a beautiful little system it's I I think    
it's pretty nice I think you know it's a nice little gooey it's not bloated and it really does make things easy if you're a new user and
it's also useful if if something's going wrong you can see what's going on immediately in the console in a way that it's just way more  
annoying to set up from the terminal so if you want to see what's at what the screen actually looks like and all that stuff connecting  
to the console from the terminal can just be a bit of a it's it's not not as fun for especially if you're new to this so let's uh move  
on to that now we are ready to install Ubuntu Server as a virtual machine so once we start up virtual machine manager which again you   
went right click on the desktop you go to system and then virtual machine manager which you can't see because my damn face is the way   
say that again virtual machine manager you're going to go new virtual machine now you get several different options here and before I   
choose the one we're using which is local install media I just wanted to explain the in report existing dis image and how cool this is  
so let's say I don't know hypothetically speaking let's say that you're uh have a somewhat messy life and you have three or four 10 to  
15y old laptop computers in your closet and each one of them is a different server like you have a Dell Latitude D620 running free PBX  
for your entire business or something like that not that you should do that not that I would ever do something like that let's say you  
have four servers what you can do is you could use DD rescue to make a dis image of each one of those servers and then you could import 
them all in here and then set them up so that they continue to run without you having to do a separate installation so you could use    
that option to virtualize all of these devices you have in your closet which is something that's very useful until you get the time you 
know set everything up properly so that that's a a quick way to do this if you already have a server set up and you want to have        
everything on one machine back here but we are using local install media because we are going to be using the iso image of the Ubuntu   
server that we downloaded for this so let's choose that install media Ubuntu 24 if you couldn't find it then you could just use browse  
local and just click on the image it automatically detected it sometimes it doesn't no big deal if it doesn't you could always just     
chuse generic Linux if it doesn't this is going to be a mail contacts and calendar server there's not like 10 million people using this 
so two CPUs 4 gigs of RAM is totally fine for this now when we're dealing with image and we're dealing with a system where I'm going to 
be transcoding proxy videos of 10 or 15,000 thumbnails that has to make and images and like videos in my phone going back to 2012 that  
we're going to give a lot of resources to this I mean you know calendar context not not the we're going to balance it right now we're   
going to enable storage for this virtual machine it I'm going to show you how to make everything so that if you want to expand the      
storage later you can so I'm going to give this 25 gigabytes but everything we do is going to be done in a way where if you want to     
expand it and make this 50 gigs or 80 gigabytes later you'll be able to which is really cool forward I'm going to call this m server I'm
using the wrong keyboard mail server this is a double fail because this keyboard is far in front of me and it's this annoying ass       
hipster keyboard I I I should have never bought this don't buy this it's it's so annoying to type so and network selection we are going 
to use our Bridge interface that we created before which is our bro our bro gives us internet okay try or install lubuntu server do or  
not do there is no try this will work on the first time just you watch this is going to perform as well as I did on the first time      
because I can edit which is more than I could say for my first time anyway you'll know that your Bridge interface and the networking is 
working properly if when it goes to connect to the time server it's instant if it's taking 15 or 15 minutes or so to go past that and   
Skip past the time thing that means that you probably did not make your IP tables rules persistent which again it's like it's an easy   
thing to forget I okay English done Ubuntu Server we do not need third party drivers here because we're literally installing this on    
software so there's no need now the same thing holds true here so okay our Bridge interface is working because we do have a DHCP but    
same thing as before I don't want a dynamic IP we're going to go we're going to uh I was about to say click we're going to enter on it  
edit ipv4 and we are going to do this manually to get a static IP so our subnet is going to be the same as before 1 192.168 do 5. Z24   
and our address is going to be 1 192.168 5.3 so one is for the Gateway which is my pfSense router number two is for this Hardware server
itself number three is going to be for this mail server now Gateway 192.168 5.1 remember your gateway is your router address which is   
the address we're putting into the web interface that we're visiting to configure pfSense name server again this is same thing as before
we're going to put the pfSense router save done no proxy address mirror address we're going to use this now we are going to partition   
our dis a couple of things to keep in mind use entire dis yes we're going to choose what shows up which is the virtual dis set up this  
disc as an lvm group yes we want it to be set up as lvm because we want to be able to resize this later if I decide I don't want 25 gigs
I actually need 20 I mean 200 gigs from my email I can take that image file expand it I can expand the lvm and then it makes it very    
very easy for me to expand my volumes and add space later so use lvm do not encrypt there is no need to encrypt this because this is on 
an encrypted drive already so you're running for this virtual machine to run it needs the computer to be turned on the drive that this  
is sitting on is encrypted so there's no need for for just doubling doubling your encryption and when we back this image up this dis    
image is going to be backed up to a to a server that is also encrypted now if you were using this in somebody else's cloud then okay    
fine there's a point if I was uploading this to some other server that's not mine I would want it to be encrypted because somebody else 
has access to the file but as long as I'm the only one with access to the file and you need to turn this computer on and enter a        
password to unlock my standard B setup to begin with I'm not going to there's no need for encrypting on top of encrypting so we're going
to hit done now the setup it's going to give you here is very silly by default it's going to give you a two gigabyte boot which is      
absolutely insane there's no need for the boot to be 200 I mean 2 G bytes that's crazy so we're going to change that to 512 next up it  
does not give you as much space as I would want for the for the logical volume because see there's a 1.5 gigs of free space because of  
this stupidly large boot partition that it gave you so I'm going to delete this we're going to take our Ubuntu volume we're going to    
make it take up the entire disc which means I actually have to delete that partition over there that it is on this is so oh Jesus Christ
okay we're going to delete the lvm all of this man because they decided that you needed a 2 gbyte boot partition it's so wasteful all   
right we're going to add a partition we're not going to format it it's going to take up the entire disc we are going to create a logical
volume manager we're going to call this m server it's going to be on this partition it's not encrypted in the free space we're going to 
create a logical volume mail server rout ext4 and that's going to be root now we are using all of our space two gigabyte Roo boot bro   
you crazy continue your name Lewis I misspelled my name again damn keyboard male server leis she was a password H I'm not going to      
enable lubun 2 Pro no need for that and we're going to install open SSH server and again uh while we're waiting for this to install no  
need to waste too much time we want to get as much done as possible so I'm going to create a static mapping so that nobody steals my    
mail server so same thing as before we're going to go over to pfSense inside of pfSense we are going to go to status no Diagnostics     
actually Diagnostics ARP table and remember that we chose 19 192.168 5.3 as our IP and that is its Mac address so now we're going to go 
to Services dhp server we can add a stack mapping Che that Mac address 1 192.168 5.3 I actually have to make host names for all these I 
forgot to on the other server should change that while I'm waiting Clinton I left the door open didn't I God Dam you want attention     
don't you you want attention I can't give you attention right now bro PL D jump up here good boy can they see oh they can only see your 
tail if I move the camera right now the stuff around it may get knocked over you can see the CPU usage of our server over here as it    
installs everything glinty want to be on camera all right clinty come on good kitty please remove the installation media then hit enter 
failed on mounting C I go away okay so we will do that manually details CD ROM so we're going to take our CD ROM I'm just going to      
remove it because I'm never going to put a CD ROM in here again we're not going to delete the Associated Storage file because oh it's   
running D careless of me all right press enter there we go it boots nice and quick because it is a virtual machine it grabbed an IP     
beautiful nice nice we're dangerously close to setting up our first service exciting isn't it all right so now we're going to move on to
installing our first service which is going to be macow we're going to be using that for calendar and Contacts And depending on my      
schedule I may go down the rabbit hole of self-hosted email because it's a lot of fun there were certain companies like Nexus that      
really used they used to provide Top Class hosting and they were good for as both a web host and for email and at some point I believe  
in April of 2023 they got the the owner of Nexus got sold to some Venture Capital firm and you notice around that time that all of the  
amazing talented customer service staff they had that were knowledgeable on scripting they knew Magento inside and out these people were
great got replaced with people that don't know anything and they don't actually know anymore how to properly set up any sort of spam    
filter spam assassin arm spam D it's all horrible so I wound up getting so frustrated with it that I just set up my own self-hosted     
email and I thought it was going to be horrible but it actually went way better I have working spam filtering now I can send email to   
any address and it doesn't show up as spam it's a bit of a rabbit F hold to set up but I I might just wind up showing you how to do it  
but this at the beginning is just going to be calendar in contacts because nexcloud is horrible at it so let's get started with that now
we're going to set up mailcow the reason that I like using mailcow for contacts and calendar and email and all that is that it takes all
of these things that used to be miserable having to set up Dove Cod manually having to set up postfix manually spam assassin manually R 
spamd manually and it takes all this stuff and it just does it for you it's beautiful it it takes so many tools and just kind of wraps  
it up into a pretty bow self-hosted email is in and of itself a rabbit hole to Hell by the definition of it even if you do use macow but
macow takes it from a rabbit hole to hell that will cause you to be in a padded room to a rabbit hole to hell that just kind of cause   
you to curse at your monitor for a few hours so let's get started with that so again in the beginning just calendaring contacts so first
things first we're going to SSH into our mail machine which is we should just set up is 192.168 5.3 again it's going to say that it     
doesn't know the authenticity of the host because I've never connected before which is good because if somebody replaced my mail server 
virtual machine with a different one I'd want to know so we going to put my password in there and I got my password in there and am I on
the right screen am I recording there's actually three times that I didn't know whether or not I was recording so I'm just going to     
check and make sure of that before I continue here and torture myself for nothing all right beautiful so the first thing that we got to 
do here is make sure that we have a nice upto-date system so apt update the dashy is going to make sure that everything is just         
automatically installs the stuff instead of asking me every time which is very nice after this we want to make sure that we have an     
upto-date version of Docker maca's documentation as of the time of making this guide in video is very strict about you having Docker 24 
or later now C's got some pretty decent documentation and their forum is actually very responsive it's a really nice Community they have
over there this tldr the snap version of Docker is cancer it's just going to give you problems because it tries to run everything inside
of its own sandbox and even if you do wind up modifying everything to be able to use its way of doing things it's just it's a pain in   
the ass you want to use the normal version of Docker not the snap version so if you're clicking through your Ubuntu server install and  
it says do you want to install Docker and you know you're going to use Docker don't do it because Ubuntu is no longer a user-friendly   
distribution Ubuntu went from a distribution in 2004 when everybody else required I use ndis wrapper and all this other crap to get     
Wi-Fi on my laptop was a distribution where it just worked now I want to I want to like select a partition to install my logical volume 
manager onto and I get a I get a completely black screen it's like it gives you a 2 gab swap partition and then it installs software    
that doesn't like work for my use case in most people's use cases it went from being a distribution where everything was just easy and  
the natural default just worked to the exact opposite so I apologize for for actually suggesting that you use this based on my old time 
understanding of Ubuntu being the distribution that was easy for newbies it's actually it's one of it's almost gotten to the point where
it's kind of like what bothers me about Apple products where they have their own way of doing something and for it's supposed to be     
easier but for some reason it just makes everything harder like I'm never going to forget the first time I no this is a ran you can fast
forward I'll include a Time St the fast forward the first time I hav R plugging an iPod into a computer and somebody wanted me to take a
a file off of it to use it to record over and I plug it in I'm like why is it not showing up as a hard drive and that was one of the    
moments where you know my my intern sitting in the room said Oh My Sweet Summer child let me tell you how Apple Works that was back in  
2007 okay back to this so I'm gonna install docker properly I'm G to install the real version of Docker will the real Docker please     
stand up and we'll get started in here so I'm going to close my old thing over here because that was actually my other server KL [Music]
SSL get.com sh it's going to install the real Docker the pretty docker pretty and witty and what I can't s should have paid more        
attention to Craig der's vocal coaching classes when I worked at 6:30 9th Avenue back in the day okay enable now Ducker going to enable 
it and start it now we need to be using a newer version for this to work with mcow it wants 24 newer beautiful beautiful Docker install 
all right I think I may have already installed that manually now we are going to get to work so we're going to go to the up directory   
we're going to use git to grab mailcow from the repository that little semicolon just allows me to move into the new directory without  
actually having to type it again if you want to run uh script in Linux or like an executable you don't you're not going to click cuz    
it's a terminal and there's no gooey obviously so you put a period a slash and then whatever it is and remember if you use Pudo anytime 
you use pseudo you're running it as an admin which means you could destroy your computer so be very careful so I'm going to use male do 
my ridiculous one from before so I had lsom server. chicken killer.com because to get a domain that's not we're going to do mail Dot    
which branch of macow do you want to use Master Branch not nightly doing this is already miserable enough without using something that  
is not uh supported I mean not in tested okay Docker composed pull is how we're going to grab our program notice how pretty it is look  
at it just grab everything isn't it beautiful this is what I was talking about with Docker instead of having well this version of Dove  
cat wants this version of of MySQL or this version of of dovecot wants this version of PHP and this version of postfix once this version
of rspamd and blah blah blah like nobody cares you just get like it the package maintainers say these are all the packages that work    
together for this particular thing they know better than me let's be real and when you download a new version of it it'll just download 
the appropriate versions for everything have you ever use Magento where you want to update from Magento 2.4 whatever to a new version   
and when you go to update you can update to the new version because you need to have like a different version of a plug-in and to update
that plugin you need this version of composer and to update composer you need a different version of PHP but then when you change PHP   
none of the other stuff works to it's it's just hair pulling like this this is this is the kind of stuff that Docker just does for you  
and it's gorgeous so Docker compose up and D which me so if I type it without this I'm going to see everything on the terminal that that
it's doing and if I close the terminal it will end whereas with this I can go back to using my terminal once everything is created which
is lovely so it's creating everything right now in a minute once this is all done I'll be able to go into the web interface and play    
with it which will be fun I look forward to playing with it it's going to be fun okay let's go into the web interface and have some fun 
all right let's go over https hold on SL1 192.168 5.3 okay default is admin moo okay so first thing we're going to do over here when we 
log in is we're going to change the administrative password to something that is not ridiculous we're going to go to system             
configuration edit this has got to be something that's you can check it against have iben pone.com to make sure you're not using a      
password that has been pwned I'm not doing that just because this is not open to the public and this is going to get deleted once I'm   
done this is just for show just to show you guys all right now we go email configuration we have to add a domain so we go add a domain  
lsom server. chicken killer.com Louis demo mail server should just keep it a demo mail server now rate limit I'm going to limit it to   
three messages a second because if if you're sending more than that you've probably broken something and you're going to get very banned
now we're going to do add domain and start soo soo is the online web gooey thingy that they use for this it's pretty good I like it I   
don't I think it's pretty nice you can do it come on little mailcow come on little mail cow all right it's a good little mail cow it's a
good kitty it's a good Mr Clinton okay we go to mailboxes we're going to add one for us add mailbox username Lewis full name Lewis      
password again it'll generate a secure one for you which is cool and it'll also make sure that the password it generates has not been   
used by other people quota if you're the only one using it you can set it to zero especially if we have this type of environment where  
this is segmented away from the rest of everything on our computer so even if you absolutely blew up and destroyed your mailbox you're  
not going to destroy your your host computer which is hosting all the other stuff you're doing all this encryption policy and everything
else all that stuff we can we can uh mess with later because I'm not doing email right now add okay so we now have a mailbox which means
that we can log into the web interface so we're going to go apps web mail and I'm going to log in using the password you don't have to  
use your domain name here actually maybe you do huh do I I think I do okay never mind Lou uh okay you do have to use the domain name my 
bad now this is your email interface and up here you have calendar and a dress book and I am going to show you how you are going to     
access these from your phone it's going to be pretty fun and you can do and I'm going to show you how you can do this from anywhere even
if you wanted to uh keep this from having a port open so that the that this part went online so let's do that I'm going to install the  
necessary application on my Android phone and I'm going to show you how I take the contacts from this and Export it over to here and    
then conversely how I can take contacts over here and put them in there all right let's get going when you start up your Android phone  
for the first time they usually ask you for a Google account and they really do push you to put in your Google account as the moment you
do that all of your contacts in your calendar when you add stuff is going to be sent up to your Google account now even if you're not   
worried about being spied on or them mining the information on exactly who you talk to and exactly what you do at every second of the   
day which you should but even if you're not afraid about that or anything at all what if they just decide to delete you I mean this is a
thing they have done this before there are people who send photos of their son to a doctor who requested them and he got his Google     
account removed and they also report him to the police and after a manual review somebody looked through his account and saw all these  
emails back and forth for with a professional licensed doctor and they thought hm they've reported into the police and his account was  
removed you don't want your contacts your calendar in your life stored on somebody else's computer particularly when they can delete you
without reason whenever they want because somebody at their company is dysfunctional and hates people who have children so what you want
to do is you're going to store it on your own server and I'm going to show you how to do that here the first thing you're going to do is
you're going to install something onto your Android phone called DAV X DX and once we do that we're going to get give this the          
permissions I don't mind giving it all the permissions you're welcome to decline it if you don't want after that it will ask you for a  
donation which by the way these people genuinely do deserve a donation they make good stuff I'm going to add an account so I'm going to 
log in with a URL and actually I'm going to do Advanced login just because I actually forget how I originally set this up so I'm        
actually going to use the local IP address of my server CU remember I can do that since I'm connected via VPN 5.3 my username is Lewis  
at password by the time you see this video and you know my password isn't entire server will be gone now it there is a certificate and  
this is a self-signed certificate over here so it's probably going to not be very happy about the details you can always change that    
later if you'd like to use your email address as your account name that's fine I'm going to call this because this is ridiculous I'm    
going to call this Louis Cloud contacts calendar add account now for calav I can sync my calendar and tasks I don't use tasks very much 
I use next Cloud notes personally but if you want you can do that and for card have you can sync your dress book now let's go over that 
I'm going to switch over to my contacts and pray that you didn't see anything stupid so what you see over here so this is a long story  
so back in the day uh 16 years ago this is a long time ago my CRM system for my business was a Blackberry 8703e and I would just add    
stuff and sometimes I had people's names but sometimes somebody would call me who's annoying and I would add them to my phone that way  
so like this is a lowballer I used to have a policy where if you my prices were so Dirt Cheap in 2008 I mean like any store I was       
literally half the price of them if you low balled me I just hung up on you so I have low baller low baller friend low baller friend    
second number cuz once that person found out that I was literally the cheapest for doing this is like oh my God I have to get this guy  
to do like no [ __ ] that I I I literally just hung up on people and it said on my website if you've low balled me you could look this  
up at archive.org if you low Bobby you're done so over here you can see the my contacts and these are on my phone now we're going to go 
to settings and accounts add account we're going to go dbx address book LS Cloud contacts calendar all that's there synchronize let's   
make sure all the stuff is added I'm not going to tell it to SN over Wi-Fi only back to my context counts for LS Rossman so I have my my
chicken killer over there it's so such a silly ass name okay now when I go back here here I can see this is this contact so personal    
address book for me now when I look there this personal address book has nothing right so what I'm going to do is I am going to go to my
normal contacts I'm going to click here settings I can export them but before I export them I'm just going to show you adding one in    
macow so over here in mailcow I'm going to add my myself a contact personal address book and person that's and okay now you can set the 
interval that it that it checks your contacts so over here it says immediately on changes so if I change something locally it'll check  
immediately and if it's if I change it on my server over here it'll check every 15 minutes see it just showed up nice very nice now I   
can add all my contact that I had on my phone over here as well so settings contacts to display here we go so you can set it to show    
different types of contacts I'm going to export my contacts to a VCF file that's a flat Earth meme that I have to make fun of a flat    
earther you saw in my download section there now I can go over here and I can import them import contacts save imported contacts too DX 
personal address book and now it's going to import them all remember this is only working because I have my VPN turned on see since this
is turned on even though I'm not connected to Wi-Fi it is going to transfer everything over to my server and if I refresh on my server I
just need to make sure that you're not seeing [ __ ] that you're not supposed to see because there's a very good chance that I am going 
to make one of my contacts personal information show up and that would be horrible so here I'm going to go back since I already exported
my contacts I'm going to tell it to only show me contacts from my personal address book that's it I don't want to see these I don't want
to see any of this I don't want to see any of this all I want to see are the contacts from my Lewis personal address book I don't want  
to see nothing else so now it's only going to show me contacts on that list my customized view of my personal address book so it        
imported everything into this personal address book now it says on local changes it's going to sync automatically it's uh I added a     
ridiculous amount of stuff there so okay I I I want to show you a list of contacts but I don't at the same time because privacy privacy 
is cool let's see how can I do this without screwing over somebody that I know here's my strategy I'm going to zoom in enough that you  
can see that it's synced but you will not be able to see real names of anybody or information just trust me here that it worked so as   
you can see it says 357 contacts it's still syncing all of the contacts that I had and they all now show up over here in my addressbook 
so now when I add contacts in my phone if I add a contact it is going to immediately sync that contact over to my server and if I add a 
contact on my server my phone will check for it once every 15 minutes now I'm going to open up my C calendar application this calendar  
application is going to be way better than what I deal with with nexcloud um just show you why at the end so first thing I do over here 
is I'm going to go over to settings in my calendar app and I'm going to make calev sync going to make sure that it's syncing with my    
other calendars I'm going to choose the personal calendar that I have and then I'm going to make sure there's no other options here that
are going to trick me later see is there any place else that I have to add this manage sync calendars okay that's the only one all right
beautiful this is made by the people that uh took over Simple Mobile tools after it became spyware so this is made by fify you can get  
this on FID it's a nice little application all right so let's say October 15th we're can add an event to my personal calendar okay be   
done with this [ __ ] video which I if I'm not done with this in two weeks I will that's going to suck okay let's make let's just for   
the hell of it make it weekly now remember I'm adding it to my personal calendar on Lewis Cloud contacts calendar not store locally only
okay bres count of calendars now when you add something locally it should update immediately here and as you can see it's added and     
because this software doesn't suck when I say 2:00 over here it actually means 2:00 over there now why would I be possibly not expected 
to do that that's an excellent question the reason that I'm using this instead of nextcloud when it comes to calendar and context are   
two reasons the first when you take a look over here this is what drove me insane with nextcloud I would have two different times so it 
would say 3 p.m. over here but when I click the event it would say 2 p.m. now what the um actually people would say is um actually your 
web browser probably is has some anti-fingerprinting things since you're so crazy Pro privacy that it doesn't know what your time Z no  
no no no no that's not what it is no no no that would make sense if it was trying to guess my time zone to change the time on both the  
fact that this piece of software thinks that it's 300 p.m. in the calendar and 2: p.m. when I click the event on the same screen no when
it comes to contacts let's go over contacts I updated nextcloud at one point from an older version to a newer version and when it did   
this it changed my settings not kidding it went from read write on my contexts to read only I had to go back and edit that and change it
myself somehow it changed the settings on my server now this is the best part if I had saved my contact locally when this woman said I'd
like to give you my phone number so that you have a chance to call me I hand her my phone she puts her number in my phone she hits save 
I wasn't connected to my VPN at the point in time the moment I connected to my VPN that contact was not saved to my phone it was saved  
to a list of things to sync to nextcloud and because nextcloud was readon the moment I turn my VPN on that contact went to nextcloud and
just disappeared it wasn't on my phone and it wasn't on nextcloud now luckily I have an autistic memory for numbers 820 2530 uses an LP 
8543 LED driver 820 2879 uses an LP 8545 LED driver which your qfn 820 2936 us an LP 8550 luckily I remembered her number because I'm   
crazy which is also why I decided to take her number to begin with it's almost like nextcloud is doing me a favor but that's a topic for
another video point being nextcloud does this type of [ __ ] and it drives me crazy whether it has two different times in the same page 
or an update randomly causes my phone to not allow me to sing contacts without informing me that that's what it did I don't have        
patience for that macow stuff just works nexcloud has its uses but I try to minimize them as often as possible the value that I believe 
I have to offer with this video is that I've already tortured with all this stuff so that you don't have to when you set up your server 
when you sync your contacts you're you're not going to lose random people's numbers because some software Dev decided to make read WR   
read only without telling you you're not going to not show up to your meeting because it's at the wrong time because your server trolled
you I want you to like I've I've worked out these Kinks over the past several years and I essentially the tldr of this video is I       
suffered so you wouldn't have to so there's a reason that we're using this in addition using nextcloud does it take more time to set up 
absolutely is it worth it I think so so that is it for this you have your contacts and your calendar how to sync it from your phone to  
your server how to have it go from your phone to actually server from your phone so should just show you that to see that that works on 
the calendar I'm going to add an event which is say hi to world world hello world on October 17th and we are going to save now I'm going
to go over to my phone and to go to C month view one of the minor aggravations with this is that it does do its syncing every 15 minutes
for some reason every time you want to refresh if you want to do it immediately you have to hit refresh list inside of dvax and it'll do
it instantly if you pull this down over here it winds up just taking forever that's that you now have working calendar and contacts and 
perhaps the ability later on for self-hosted email next we're going to be going over self-hosted email self-hosted email is like most of
my relationship decisions just because you can doesn't mean you should they high maintenance they're complicated and you're going to    
regret it if you would like to go ahead with this anyway as I often do you're welcome to follow this guide in all seriousness           
self-hosted email is for many reasons a bad idea if you're watching this guide you're most likely a beginner doing the other stuff as a 
beginner sure you want to sync your contacts you want to transfer your photos email self-hosted email is is it's not fun there's a lot  
of things that may go wrong in the process and you will spend a lot of time troubleshooting [ __ ] that you probably don't understand   
and it will drive you insane but but it is something that you have the capability to do and for me to tell you to install mailcow for   
task calendar contacts other stuff like that and not show you how to use it for mail it's no fun so let's go over this from the from the
very beginning of how to set up self-hosted email one of the benefits of this is that at the end of the day you're going to be the one  
running your mail server which means that if you're using a host like nexs that just recently got sold to a venture capital firm and    
replaced all their tech support staff that were Geniuses at scripting Magento and everything else with Outsource people that don't know 
[ __ ] so their spam controls don't work anymore you don't have to deal with that anymore because you're going to have working spam     
controls because you control your spam controls not somebody else so you're you're not at the mercy of people that don't read your      
tickets that don't understand basic Computing so let's go over this here so first thing you're going to do is you're going to go over to
your macow interface so you would log into that by either going mail server. home. arpa or your IP address which would be 192.168 5.3   
based on how we set it up this may of course be different for you you're going to log in with the you're can to log in as an            
administrator you're going to log in as an administrator by remembering your password and once you remember your password you pet the   
kitty and and uh you also make sure that the kitty is on stream screen there we go that's the kitty look at how cute he is isn't he a   
good kitty he is a good kitty isn't he yes good kitty I got him a chair next to me so he could sit here when I do my videos and he's    
been very happy to actually just sit on my chair instead he's a good Clinton and once you're done petting the kitty that is when we get 
started so the first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to create an account on a website called postmark.com no  
man is an island and if you want to try to do selfhosted email nobody's going to accept any of your emails because they're going to     
assume that you're a spammer and for the most part they should we as a society have decided that it's more important to us that we don't
receive spam than to make it easy for any Tom Dick or Harry to send email from their own home server so while you can technically set up
self-hosted mail just fine you you're going to run into a situation where nobody actually gets your mail I don't mean that it's going to
show up in their spaming box I mean that it's not going to show up at all so there are certain tolerances that these servers have if    
something Falls below a certain score it gets delivered to your junk or your spam folder rather than your inbox but if it's just so far 
down you don't even get it in your junk or your spam folder it just gets rejected before it even hits your inbox and that's where a lot 
of people that try to run mail servers out of their house with a residential IP address on a residential block that's what's going to   
happen to you because these mail servers are going to assume and Gmail assumes that you got hacked and that you're a part of a botn net 
or something rather than assuming that you are actually a legitimate person running a mail server because the ratio of people that run  
mail servers in their house that are not doing it for nefarious reasons to people that just double click anything while using Windows XP
Service Pack 2 and get hacked that wind up becoming mail service for spam it's so much further in that yeah just no real email provider 
will take you seriously so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set up something called postmark for SMTP relay what this
does is when you are sending an email come back Lindy good K good kid he's a good kid so when you are going to be sending email you're  
not going to send it directly to the person you're sending it to your server is going to relay it through postmark so when you send an  
email Gmail or Hotmail or iCloud or nobody watching this is old enough to use Hotmail but if you are use Yahoo or Alta Vista email      
addresses you they will not see it as spam because they trust postmark so you're going to make an account on this website and when you  
first register an account with them they're not going to turn you on immediately they're probably going to ask you for some sort of uh  
they're going to ask for some sort of authentic they're going to want to figure out if you're a scammer like they may take one or two   
days to look into your account they're not going to bang you on the first date they want you they want to be taking out to dinner first 
before they're just going to let you use their services to send email so once you're done with that and once they've let you in you're  
going to see a screen that looks like this when you click on servers let's make sure the kitty is in the screenshot there we go that's  
the kitty good kitty and what you're going to do is you would click create server name of your server let's call it uh send mail demo   
you're going to choose live because as Bill O'Reilly said [ __ ] it we're going to do it live you click default transactional stream    
sends emails with smcp and username and password so we're going to keep this in mind over here and this let's just leave this window    
open for a moment and go back to macal now in macow we are going to go system configuration routing and now over here add sender        
dependent transport this is where we're going to copy and paste our credentials for SMTP relay so copy and paste smtp.at docomo host    
then we're going to use port 587 So you you're going to you're not going to put that in a port box you just put a colon and then 587    
you're going to take this username and this password over here that are the same that's your API key and you just put that as username  
and as password you click add and there you go you have your SMTP relay next up we're going to set up our domain so if you're going to  
have to go to a you're going to have to go to a place to buy a domain name like you know God daddy name cheap there's there's tons of   
different websites where you can buy a domain name like you do you uh go choose the website to buy your domain name that you like and   
I'm I'm just going to show you how it works over here for a throwaway domain name that I have uh this was a play on drivers.com WE      
registered the domain name called stev savers.com because Steve was the main data recovery technician and then you know he he was in    
charging you $2,000 because you had a little bit of blint in your charge port of your iPhone so I registered stev savers.com a while ago
as a troll so I'm just going to show you the the DNS page here so whatever your provider is they're going to have a page where you set  
up DNS for your domain name and you are going to have to have a little basic knowledge here of how to buy a website I mean buy the      
domain name for a website here so this is what it looks like in name chep so these are my two records for name for Steve savers.com each
of these redirects to my website's data recovery page we're going to add mail records next so that this stuff works and uh that's going 
to be the the next thing we got to do so over here in mailcow let's go back to mailcow we're going to go system email configuration and 
we're going to add a domain so I'm going to add a domain equal to what the domain was that I bought which is going to be stev savers.com
so Steve savers.com Steve saves the day with data recovery template default all the stuff like how many aliases do you want how many    
mailboxes do you want default mailbox quota that that's all up to you I'm not going to decide that rate limit messages per second I     
would say if you're sending more than if it's more than a few me any messages per second I think if you're sending message per second   
you've probably broken something something on your mail server so I'm going to set it to messages per minute and I would say if there   
are more than 10 messages per minute being sent then something has probably gone wrong here for selector you're going to choose dkim    
2048 2048 add admin and then restart soo soo is the Online mail container and you're going to have to restart that when you add new     
domains mailboxes stuff like that so you don't want to do that manually it's a pain in the ass so just click add domain and restart     
container and next up we we're going to go and add a mailbox now so up here once you and you're still going to be in email but if you're
not email configuration is where you go email top configuration go mailboxes now we can add a mailbox now I'm going to go let's say up  
here when you add a mailbox you're not going to add put over here like Steve sters.com you're going to just type the left part before   
the ad so Steve and then for domain I could choose stev savers.com I could type Steve now the password this will not only generate a    
password for you but it will also check if your password is on have ipone.com which is a great website that has a list of every password
that's ever been publicly released along with the username so if you're if you're reusing a password that you've used in the past and   
that's a password that has been leaked before you'll know over here for encryption policy check enforc TLS incoming and enforce TLS     
outgoing and you could set a rate limit for that as well but I set it for for the domain so I'm good uh Grant direct access to login to 
soo that is the online interface they have to be clear you'll be able to use whatever application you want with this I'm not here to    
tell you what to use but I'm just going to Grant direct access to login to soo because sometimes it's convenient if you don't have a    
mail client set up or if you just set one up so there you go now you have set this up to where the accounts are set up properly inside  
of mailcow and you've also set a postmark for sending mail the next thing you're going to have to do is going and have to set up the DNS
records and this is the part that is the the part that most people are probably going to get wrecked on so let's go through this very   
very carefully and very very slowly the first thing we need to do is go back here to domains click on domains click on edit for the     
domain we just made scroll down and you will see this domain over here domain sters.com we need to keep this because we're going to put 
this in our in our our website's DNS also remember when we added postmark forn TP relay so that our emails would go through postmark you
need to put that over here sender dependent transports this is not going to show up when you're creating your domain but it will show up
when you edit your domain so when you go to system I mean when you go to email configuration domains you go to your domain when you     
click edit it cender dependent transports choose the postmark SMTP relay save changes now this over here is going to be important so we 
need to keep that in mind put that you know don't don't put this on your on your monitor with a postage but just you know treat treat   
this like your bank password but just keep it in this window for a moment while we uh set up our DNS so let's go over here and we're    
going to add DNS records so what this does again it's going to tell when somebody goes to stev savers.com mail sters.com it's going to  
tell it where to go this is going to be used to make sure that we don't have scammers pretending to be us using our domain name it just 
we're going to be adding a bunch of records that make this stuff easier so and also make it work and more better uh let's go through    
each record so the first one we're going to add is called a cname record so for host I'm also going to have this in the written guide so
do not assume that you have to like squint on screen and type this manually if you type this stuff manually it'll drive you insane so   
you're going to have to copy and paste a lot of this from your own personal setup I'll tell you which ones if you're using postmark then
this is going to be the value pm. mtv. net now because it is so easy to screw up anything with self-hosted mail I am going to explicitly
copy and paste these records because I don't want to get wrecked and next up we're going to set up what's called a DeMark record we go  
over here to type of record go text and we are going to put this this record is here so host is going to be underscore DeMark so DeMark 
one is going to stay the same in your configuration uh you're just going to change the mail to your own domain and add an email where   
you want to receive something called a Demar report so it helps protect you from email spoofing next up we're going to add postmarks    
dkim record so when you go over to postmarks web interface uh let's you're going to see something at the top called sender signatures   
and after you click sender signatures there's going to be a button for you to add your domain so let's click that add domain or         
signatures you're going to Sender signatures add domain or signature and then we're going to add our domain don't add send just don't   
say single email address on a domain send from any email address on a domain this is more technical but you know that's that's the whole
point of having this set up here that's what you that's what you got me for this lovely put in stev savers.com click verify domain now  
it's going to give you these two records and this is over here this is the record that I just told you it's this is the same for pretty 
much everybody who's using postmark the PM uh record over there the pm. MTV This Record is going to be very unique to your specific     
person right so we cop again copy and paste they make this very very easy for you to just copy going to go over here oh see the one     
thing I didn't copy and paste DeMark I almost messed up add new record we're going to add a text record host we copy and paste type text
add this value this is this thing over here this long ass [ __ ] and keep this on automatic check save changes now the records are there
now you're going to have to wait a little bit for this to update so we have some other things that we have to add I'm not going to try  
and verify this immediately even though I'm impatient and kind of want to because I know it's going to take a little while for this to  
get updated like if you change your number the phone book doesn't immediately represent that you change your number it'll reflect it in 
the next Edition now it doesn't take a year to have your phone number updated over here but it's it's it's often going to it's not going
to be instant usually next up let's add the record so this is the record for us sending email from our domain using postmark now we have
to set up the records for our email within mailcow itself so if we go back to over here we go email configuration our domain Steve      
savers.com go edit now here's your domain and here's the key part so dickham doore domain key dickham dickham I'm such a [ __ ] child   
sometimes Okay add new record go text for host dickamore domain key and the rest of it this long ass [ __ ] over here is going to be    
what goes in value and automatic still hit the little check box over there there we go wait for my video program to stop freezing come  
on OBS don't let me down there's a David Bowie song on the album Black Tie White Noise don't let me down and out something like that    
that's a really good album it doesn't sound like all the other David Boe albums or anything else at the time really next up we're going 
to add something called an SPF record this is going to have be a text record the host is going to be an at symbol so of this record the 
parts that are going to say the same for you versus be different the SPF part with MX and a that has to stay exactly the same this is   
going to tell the other servers to check your MX and a record the include part is to be that's something you're going to have to change 
if you're not using postmark or if postmark ever changed ches this at some point in time and the all part I would keep the same if you  
want stricter enforcement you could change this but that's something I would change once you realize that the [ __ ] that you put       
together actually worked next up we're going to add a record for what mail the what mail. sters.com actually resolves to now we're not  
going to set an a record because you don't have a static IP address you probably have some residential [ __ ] ass internet like I do so 
what you would do you take the host you make that mail that's going to stay the same the one that that's going to be different for you  
is going to be the target what is the Dynamic DNS that you set up did you set up your Dynamic DNS you probably didn't set up blw homes  
server. chicken killer.com whatever you set up when you were setting up your Dynamic DNS is what is going to go over here that's going  
to be what points to your IP so what this is saying is that mail. sters.com should reach my IP address next add new record okay we're   
going to set up email client AO configuration I personally don't give a [ __ ] about this like I know my ports what my ports are but if 
if you if you give a [ __ ] I guess it's a good idea yeah fine so so we're going to do this for this Auto config and autodiscover I'm   
including this because like maybe somebody that knows what they're actually doing unlike me may watch this they go why didn't you put   
this here if you want male clients to be able to figure out what your ports are because they're going to try to figure out what exactly 
is your Port like if you if you don't you know if you ever used Outlook and just you add your username and password and your mail server
and you don't have to enter the port and the encryption type and all that rubbish manually I don't use that but like I I already know my
IMAP receiving Port is 993 my SMTP sending port with t LS is 587 so like I just I I don't care but you should care you should care okay 
now we're going to go to mail settings no email service we're going to set up what's called an MX record MX not mxe a custom MX so here 
it's it's going to be called something like mail MX record custom MX whatever mail settings over here you're going to find that with    
your domain your host at that's always going to be the same the value is going to be whatever your mail server is so in my case it's    
mail. stev savers priority 10 because I'm a 10 that's right 10 because I'm a 10 I was about to put something in here and I forgot what  
it was uh oh uhoh well I'll remember what that is later I'm sure when when something doesn't work I'll remember that I forgot something 
there okay now we've waited a little bit let's see if our DNS has propagated I'm going to go back to our postmark window where we added 
this stuff for Steve Savers I'm going to verify yay awesome what postmark is doing is it's checking stev savers.com and it wants to see 
if we have these records so now what I've done is I've told postmark that this is my domain name the only person that's going to be a   
there's two people that are going to be able to update this a me B whoever hacks me 5 Seconds after I release this [ __ ] video but in  
all seriousness the purpose of this being here is so that postmark knows that I own stev savers.com as I said postmark is not going to  
let me send email through their servers immediately like they know they want to take you out a few dates they want to get to know you a 
little bit you know they want to feel comfortable with you and that's what we're doing with this process over here once this part is    
done you're going to be dealing with pfSense firewall rules if if you want to actually [ __ ] receive email here so you would do        
something like this now there's only one port that you need to open to the public just so I can be clear here there's only one port that
you technically need to make open to the public which is Port 25 and this is another reason that why I think that that just doing       
selfhosted mail for all of you is this going to be a horrible bad [ __ ] idea because you don't like yeah it's like I I don't think that
you guys opening ports to the public at this particular point in your journey is a great idea and obviously self-hosted emails of [ __ ]
dumpster fire in general the one port that you got open to the public is Port 25 because Port 25 is the port on which you are going to  
be receiving email from everybody else you you have to open that retrieving mail from your mail server so that you can open it in       
Thunderbird or Outlook or K9 on your phone or whatever the hell else that you use that you can use the VPN you could connect through VPN
so when it asks you for your server you could just type in after connecting to your VPN mail server. home. arpa or 192.168 5.3 when     
configuring emailing your client because we use 2168 5.3 for our mail server you don't have to open everything else if you want your    
clients to be able to connect without a VPN then you got to open ports but there's there's no getting around opening Port 25 you got to 
do that because like you need people to be able to send you mail like how how are they going to send you mail if you block the port so  
we're going to make a firewall rule for that over here welcome I'm Louis from the future and I didn't realize that while I was recording
that segment of the video that I never hit the shortcut on my keyboard that switches The View back over to the screen so that you could 
see what I'm doing so let's go over that part again you have to create rules in PFS firewall so that you can actually have traffic      
allowed in on Port 25 so you can receive mail it is important that Port 25 be open you need this to be open so that other servers can   
send you mail if you don't open port 25 you will never receive email it's important that Port 25 be open now there are two different    
types of rules that we can set up in pfSense the first isnat and the second are rules natat is what says what computer gets what traffic
so you have one IP address when I go to what is myip.com you're GNA have one IP address regardless of the computer that I'm using on my 
network any computer that's on my network when they go to what ism.com gets this this is what the world sees however I can have over 200
computers on my network so when somebody sends me an email how does it know which computer on my network to direct it to that's what    
natat does natat says traffic on Port 25 go here traffic on Port 5060 go to the phone system traffic on Port 80 go to the web server and
so on and so forth and these can all be different computers in the network what firewall rules do is once that traffic has been directed
to that computer is it actually allowed to go through so think of nat like the person at the restaurant that figures out which person   
gets which table and then think of the firewall rule like the bouncer that decides whether or not they're allowed to go through so we're
going to set up both here and the great thing about PF sense is that when you set up a n rule it sets up a firewall rule for you as well
so we're going to need to forward Port 25 over to our mail server computer so what you would do is you would go to firewall and then    
natat once you go to firewall andn you'll be on forward and this is where we want to be we're going to click the add button over here to
add a rule now the interface is wan because that's where the traffic is coming in the protocol is going to be TCP the destination is    
going to be a Wan address and the source is going to stay at any remember I don't know the IP addresses of the mail servers that are    
going to try to email me I can't predict that so it needs to be any and all destination is going to be the when address Port range is   
going to be set over here to Port 25 and redirect Target IP this is going to be our mail server which is located at 192.168 5.3 and the 
redirect Target Port is going to be Port 25 I don't want to change it so we keep it there this is going to be receive emails and add    
Associated filter rule needs to be there so that we create a rule in our firewall as well you would save and then you hit apply changes 
and then when you go to firewall in rules it should show up here here now let's also go over aliases because this is something that's   
going to be important if you want people to actually be able to contact your mail server that are not on your VPN right now the only    
people that are going to be able to connect to your mail server to actually log into their inbox are going to be people that are on your
VPN you're not connecting on Port 25 Port 25 is where your email server is receiving emails from others but that is not going to be the 
port that you would enter into Thunderbird or Outlook or any of your email programs to be able to actually access your inbox and receive
mail if you wanted to do that outside of your VPN what you would do is you would go over to firewall and then aliases you would have a  
section that looks like this where you can add an alas so I could say trusted mail server IPs and then I could put over here you know   
trusted mail server IPs and then I could add the IP address of each client that I want to be able to connect to my mail server and      
receive mail so for instance if I had an office and I didn't want that office to have VPN access to my network for whatever reason or I 
wasn't but to have them M VPN access I could add their IP address here so that when I create my firewall rules to forward all the ports 
that are in the guide over to my mail server I'm not opening it to the world I'm only opening it to those IPS this is a unique case that
you may have if you're using something like fresh desk fresh desk is a customer relationship management system and this allows you to   
use their email system but you can also use your own email system and if you're using fresh test to manage your customer tickets and    
your emails and everything like that and you are using your own mail server for this this needs to be able to connect to your mail      
server somehow and you would you add all these individual IPS to it so that they would be allowed so if somebody else tries to connect  
to your mail server on the mail server ports of like 993 for receiving or 587 for sending they would not even see a mail server running 
the only people that would see a mail server running is if one of these IPS connected to it if you put those IPS into aliases and then  
made a firewall rule for them so this is how you create a firewall rule in pfSense you're going to go to firewall and then next this is 
going to be where we're directing traffic anything that's coming in on Port 25 we're going to direct to our mail server and have it be  
port25 so if you're trying to visit my w address which is this over here when you go to what ismy ip.com and you're on port25 go here   
and then our firewall rule says we're going to allow that I'll allow that and that's about that now with that I will go back to editing 
my 11h hour long video 11 hour long video now that DNS is set up we can have a little bit of fun so first because it's self-hosted email
it's going to say a little prayer if you don't believe in God and you're an atheist just pretend you do for a moment so that your       
selfhosted email can work okay we're going to go to mail server home. arpa and apps web mail so when you go to mail server. home. arogo 
you'll get to the web mail so you can bookmark that the password is going to be whatever you set when you set this up originally I'm not
going to set the you could even set this up as an application from mail to Links in Firefox look at that look at that write a new       
message we're going to use the spam email address that I have that's throwaway and and I'll send some mail to myu I'll send mail to     
three different places so one Lou Rosman group medium difficulty Steve at stev savers.com like if if if it doesn't send to my own email 
address I've massively [ __ ] something up and Rosman group@gmail.com which if if I can send to a Gmail address I've done good let's see
okay we're going to send an email and this is where the prayer comes in so it's sent quickly that is a good sign okay okay so the email 
sent to myself that's the easy one now did you show up where you're supposed to oh look at that I just making sure I didn't have        
anything in here that I didn't need I love my koi fish they are pretty it made it through scw a [ __ ] Gmail Man okay now we're going to
reply I love koi fish too I am glad you agree Steve from Steve Savers and here's where the fun comes in because all right I have a      
secret to tell you all I did not want to lose my home internet during the time I'm setting up this tutorial so this router is actually  
behind another router I I showed you how to plug this directly into the home internet for the first setup but because I don't want my   
camera system and everything else to not work for the entire time I'm doing this this is act I actually put this on the landan of my    
other router so this is like a router within a router so I have a little bit more added complexity than you are here so let's see if    
this works okay come on you can [ __ ] do it bro you can do it you can do it receive the email HH HH I believe in you you can do it it  
worked it sent immediately I love my koifish too I'm glad you agree and there you have it s an email now we're going to go a little bit 
further and go and do some spam filtering setup this is supposed to work in a way where you take your spam and you just move it to Jung 
and it's automatically going to teach the system whether or not that's Jung which is kind of cool the way that you can log in here to   
see the rpam D web interface is when you're logged in as an administrator not not as your user but as an administrator to mailcow so    
let's just show you you you go to https whatever your mailcow address was admin [Music] password system configuration R actions R spam D
access you're just going to set your password there that you're going to use for rpam D and it says please wait [ __ ] that I'm         
impatient you go to rpam D yeah that's what you get for being impatient put your password in and you can see the stuff that you trained 
now you have a bunch of little cool options here you could miss you could train stuff manually you could upload stuff for it to learn   
from and also in the here if you log out as admin you log in spam filter and you can set this however you please I have a public to the 
2 million people email account so obviously I'm a little bit more more towards the moving [ __ ] to the left side so less spam gets     
through you feel free to tweak these to your heart's content and at this point you now have selfhosted mail which you shouldn't have you
shouldn't do this don't do this very bad idea just because you can doesn't mean you should high maintenance complicated and you'll      
regret it later with that let's move on to the next section and I hope you learn something next up we're going to be discussing home    
assistant many of you hate the idea of a cloud connected home you don't like the idea of a smart home and I don't blame you the reason  
you probably hate the idea of a cloud connected home is because at this point in time they have become memes whether we're talking about
Amazon shutting down somebody's home because they had a racist doorbell or we're talking about LG having end user license agreements for
their washing machine that says that they sell your data I don't want a washing machine that sells my data I don't want my smart home to
be shut down because some [ __ ] delivery person thinks that a doorbell has the capacity to be racist this is not the world that I want 
to live in however you do not have to live in that world you can have a smart home that is controlled by you that is utilizing open     
source software that you have full control over anywhere that there is some sort of monthly subscription proprietary nonsense closed    
Source garbage that is attached to a piece of Smart Home Hardware there is a home assistant programmer out there working tirelessly     
until 3: in the morning reverse engineering it so that you don't have to use the manufacturers crap it's a beautiful piece of software  
and it gives you control over your home and your life all the smart devices in my home do not connect to the internet they are not      
allowed to connect to the internet they're only allowed to connect to a virtualized instance of Home assistant and that's it and I can  
control them from anywhere in the world if I'm getting home a few hours later than usual I don't have to have my AC set to turn on and  
be cool at 7:00 I can control it and I say okay I'm going to be home at 1:00 in the morning 12:45 I'll turn the AC on so it's cool by   
the time I get home and it doesn't connect to the internet there's no subscription fee and it's all free no spying no [ __ ] so let's   
get started how do we do this the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to home-assistant.io that is their website and on  
their website when we click on this little menu over here we're going to go to installation we're going to scroll down to home assistant
operating system their recommendation is that you install home assistant operating system this is home assistant OS view tutorial and   
they're going to give us an image and we're going to right click on the KVM image not the virtual box image but the KVM qc2 image now I 
am going to download it onto my server computer so we're going to SSH into our server SSH into our server W get going to paste the URL  
and it's going to download now we are going to unzip this because this is zipped file or compressed with something XZ file why you      
messaging me I'm busy now that we have decompressed our image we are going to move that to our directory that has all of our virtual    
machine images sud V home assistant we're going to move this over to far lib livert images now I'm going to make sure that it has the   
proper permissions to be able to work with my virtualized environment so you're going to have it be owned by lib vert Kimu lib vert Kimu
group far lib lib vert images and now we're going to set the proper permissions to it so it is read WR by the owner but not writable or 
executable by other people beautiful now that that's done I am going to turn on the guey to this and we are going to use the virtual    
machine manager there you don't really have to use the goey but for new people let's setting up up the VM it's it's nice to use the goey
we go over here to if you just forget where virtual machine manager is you right click the desktop applications system virtual machine  
manager this allows you to create a new virtual machine we're not going to use local installation media remember we're not using a cdrom
or a USB installer to install it onto something they've provided us with a full disk image that has everything that we need to do what  
we're looking to do so we're going to import an existing disk image the path is going to be in default because we already moved it over 
here so we just going to double click I'm going to choose generic Linux 2022 it says in the instructions over here to choose generic    
default for your operating system so instead of generic you know what I might just generic links I just m will choose generic or unknown
OS it says usage is not recommended but you tell me to then again it did say generic default for the operating system generic default   
generic default Linux or generic default in general I will use my dice again we will choose generic Linux 2022 YOLO memory 2048 they    
requested two CPUs I kind of want to change that to one there's a part of my brain that just breaks at the idea of using like if you    
told toddler Lewis that we would be using two CPU cores for a thermostat that's a world anyway home assistant I got to get used to this 
hipster keyboard customize configuration before install we're going to be using our Bridge device finish next it's going to want us to  
choose overview Farm more ufi x864 now it says to choose one that does not have secure boot however there are two that don't say secure 
boot there's this one and there's this one so I'm going to YOLO and choose this one because the instructions don't specify which one to 
use it says choose the over hermer UEFI x86-64 but then it breadcrumbs me with that dot dot dot my face out of the way here I don't need
to see myself now it says to click add Hardware on the bottom left and select Channel we're going to add an org Kimu guest agent however
oh yes I do want to save my changes it looks like I already have this so this is a strange one it says add Hardware bottom left and     
select Channel select type Unix this and select begin installation however we already have that over here and I remember from the last  
time I tried doing this from my own installation that when I did that it gave me an error code so I'm not going to do that I'm going to 
click begin installation and I'm going to watch it boot now I don't know what IP address this thing is going to grab so I'm going to    
remember I'm not I I want to I didn't set up an IP address on installation so I don't actually know what it's doing here I have to look 
and see if it gives me a clue or a hint a Chum just a Crum come on technically okay here we go home assistant. local 8123 there we go   
never mind give I don't want that it gives me the IP address 192.168 5.16 192.168 5.16 we're going to put that in my browser 192.168    
5.16 semicolon no colon semicolon colon semicolon the two dots one I should really know what that is I went to New York City public     
school man you can't hold preparing home assistant this may take 20 minutes or more if you take 20 minutes minutes or more on an i71    
14700 K that has not yet oxidized I will punch this machine in the face so hard no [ __ ] way in hell I would have given you all like 14
cores if I do that come on oh gee anyway it's a good system it's a good system we're going to be nice to home assistant okay so it's    
going to take a little bit of time well that's taking time since it seems like it's going to take quite a bit of time I will get started
prepping my thermostat and I'm going to show you how we make a thermostat that that I can connect to home assistant but that does not   
connect to the internet oh here we go actually it's already done might as well okay create my smart home let's make a user account stop 
with the autocomplete [ __ ] stop with the autocomplete [ __ ] so obnoxious covers everything search for my home address no thank you my
country I'll be in the United States we're can to use Freedom Units United States no no no no no see how it's off by default very nice  
of them settings the first thing I'm going to do take a look at devices and services now usually it searches through your network and it
actually finds everything that's there it's not doing that here because uh this is its own isolated Network that's separate from my     
other network but if you had devices on your network it would actually look something like this I'm going to log into my home assistant 
that I have so you could see so this is mine like my AC is right there I don't have my lights on it yet because I haven't added them but
I can go to settings and I can go to devices and services and it literally shows you everything on my network like so it actually looks 
for everything that is on your Lan and then it will offer this to you it this is very very much so plug-and playay it really does try to
make your life as easy as possible which I really do appreciate so let's go back to this installation that I'm working on right now so  
you can go create your smart home and I already did that actually so there now what I'm going to do is I am going to show you how I     
would add my thermostat this here is a venstar thermostat this is the biggest piece of [ __ ] on Earth I bought this because it was the 
one of the few thermostats that I saw when I the time that I bought it that nobody had a problem with there were a lot of thermostats or
yeah I got this to work other people said they couldn't get it to work they were unconfirmed but this one was a confirmed working one   
for home assistant not for actual use see how it's a touchcreen thermostat and it has buttons it's a piece of [ __ ] whoever designed   
this thermostat I want to there's a there's a picture I imagine what their face looks like and I want to put it on a dartboard and just 
throw darts at it every single day the one redeeming quality of whoever designed this thermostat is that they designed it in a way that 
allows me to use it with home assistant because this [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] you literally need to use this with home assistant in order 
to use it so let's go over the first thing you have to do is when you get this piece of [ __ ] is you're going to connect it to a Wi-Fi 
network now I've already connected it to a Wi-Fi network then I'm going to be keeping it connected to my old Network because getting    
this attached to a new one it will drive me insane now it has something called local API options here and you turn on local API you're  
going to turn on the the user I have the username is second floor I actually just deleted that [ __ ] uh oh did it save okay thank God  
it didn't save basic off password and that's my air conditioner password over there for Wi-Fi setup it'll show you a list of Wi-Fi      
networks in your area and then you connect to the Wi-Fi network of your choice and then once once that's done you can go over to your   
computer and add it also you can give it a static IP which I did here so when you go to Wi-Fi Wi-Fi setup one of the things that I did  
was I gave it a static IP so I'm going to look away while I type this in I'm actually not able to edit the static IP I believe without  
reconnecting to my network I have to retype in my password for my Wi-Fi Network in order to log into it so you go manual setup network  
settings and then I can give it a static IP so the way I've made this work is this is the address of my other pfSense router my normal  
one now now the touch screen is sensitive that's the IP address that I want this to have that's the Gateway and the DNS is going to be  
my pfSense router and subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and that's that so you do the manual setup that over there is a kitty Hello          
blackberry and this is a thermostat that's a kitty that's a thermostat that's a Kitty and this is a piece of [ __ ] thermostat but it's 
my thermostat I think my phone battery is going to run out before this finish is connecting oh my God one of the fun things is you can  
add wallpapers to it via an SD card but it can only be an SD card that some I it has to be something like less than two gigs or some    
ridiculous [ __ ] I forget what it is but the this the only ones that will work with this it's such a piece of [ __ ] but it works with 
home assistant let's try this again I know that works okay that's there so we hit next let me try this again it's zip it's zipping the  
Modern Way amazing you only have to do this once twice if you want to show other people how to do it okay [ __ ] this can I go back can 
IIT cancel okay what did I do what the [ __ ] did okay so even though I chose a different network it's actually connecting to guest when
I didn't click guest so I was clicking SSD but because this touchcreen was designed in 1987 it still keeps registering that I clicked a 
different one see how many times I had to do that whoever chose the touchcreen for this [Music] [Music] I hope the person made [Music]  
this all right so those are our network settings next what I didn't even hit next yet the [ __ ] no no way no way Zip Zip finally okay  
it's done now we go back over to our computer before I show you how to add that to home assistant because we're on the topic of         
connecting Internet of Things devices to our Network it's important to talk about how we treat devices is that we truly do not trust I  
don't trust that thermostat but my Threat Level or trust level in that is far different than it is for something like a a hick Vision   
Chinese camera if there was something I truly didn't trust that thing could still go online even if I blocked its IP from connecting to 
the internet I told it this is your static IP so it's going to grab that IP now I block that IP from connecting to the internet but what
if that device was truly malicious what if that thing was put in there by an apple spy that wanted to collect blackmail on through the  
microphone in the um in the thermostat so that they could get they could stop me from lobbying for right to repair some some sort of    
crazy [ __ ] like that like I'm not I'm just trying to come up with a ridiculous example out of my head what that device could do if it 
was truly malicious is it could say I'm going to ignore the static IP that Lewis asked me to have and I'm going to try to grab a bunch  
of different IPS I'm going to keep going through this subnet until I find some IP address that I can grab that allows me to connect to  
the internet and then it could if I didn't allow that IP address to connect what if there's another IP address address on that subnet   
that it's allowed to grab and connect to the internet it could technically do that now I could do something where I limit it by the MAC 
address but that device could then also spoof its Mac address that's doable I mean graphine os does that when you connect to Wi-Fi      
networks it does it for security so you don't can fingerprint it as easily now you could create vlans but that requires that you buy a  
switch that has VLS and I'm a cheap skate I I didn't get a switch with vlans that that the router that I have is literally like almost a
10-year-old desktop computer that has another network interface card put into it that I found at my store so what I have is I don't have
two ports on my router the way I would deal with this is I have three ports on my router on the pfSense router I'm making to show you   
everything when you go to interfaces I have W and I have Lan and then I have the openvpn but on the router that I use at home I have W  
Lan and cameras this is a separate Network alog together let's show you how this works the landan network gives out IPS from 1          
192.168.1.2 to 255 and the cameras interface gives out addresses from 1921 168.3 do2 to or three in this case technically to 255 these  
networks are not allowed to talk to one another they're separate Networks so it would be physically impossible for that uh for that     
camera to grab an address on the network that is trusted it's only able to grab ones from the network that is not trusted and every     
device on that switch is not allowed to connect to the Internet so when I go to my firewall rules and I click on cameras you'll see over
here that all of these cameras everything on here is blocked from going to the internet and everything else is blocked from going to it 
it's all universally blocked they cannot connect to and nothing on this network can connect to anything else and nothing else can       
connect to it the only things that can connect are the specific exceptions I have created I allow my VPN client to attach to the cameras
so that I can view my little koi fish when I am uh when I am away I allow my underwater camera to connect to my underwater camera       
clients which are the computers that I allow to view the koifish and vice versa and I allow my security cameras which are all these hick
Vision cameras over here to attach to my network video recorder computer and my network video comp uh recorder computer can attach to   
the security cameras to make life easy pfSense has a feature called aliases so instead of having to add a new firewall rule every single
time I add a camera to that Network I can simply say in the firewall rule my just instead of it being an IP address I can say security  
cameras and then I can list all of them over here so nothing on that network is technically allowed to connect to the internet if I     
truly fundamentally did not trust that thermostat that thermostat would not be on my land that thermostat would be over here but do I   
trust venstar to make a touchcreen no do I trust them to make an interface worth a [ __ ] no do I think that they're actively           
maliciously going through every IP on my home network behind my back just to connect to the Internet so that something in there can spy 
on me not really like I'm not I don't think so it's possible since I've talked [ __ ] about the guy that made it that maybe he adds that
but it can't connect to the internet right now I just thought I would throw that in there so you can have an idea obviously if you      
wanted to go completely into this what you could do is you could set you could learn about vlans and you could learn about all that     
other stuff I'm not getting into that in this video because and admittedly for my own purposes for my home network I don't even need to 
get into that for this video because what I would do is I would simply attach a Wi-Fi access point which is separate I would have a     
separate Wi-Fi access point that connects to the switch that I connect all the devices that I don't trust to and I would treat them in  
that particular manner I just wanted to walk you through how I would do that because not going to be connecting a bunch of iot devices  
on camera one by one because that would require that I disconnect everything I have and start from scratch and that would just make me  
miserable 2 three I believe it was here we go so let's add an integration I'm going to go settings devices and services add integration 
now we're going to type in venstar host 16818 username second floor password you see pin code we don't have that uses an SSL certificate
yes submit it's zipping the modern way as fast as you can expect a venstar thermostat here we go now I can make an area for it I'll call
it living room now this is the fun part you go to overview this is like I don't I don't want this this is aggravating so I'm going to   
I'm going to get rid of that thing because that makes me mad just looking at it edit dashboard okay I want to hide this thing let I need
to figure out how to get rid of that thing cuz that is [ __ ] ugly let's see first things first let's make sure my browser window is in 
view lovely so we're going to edit this area okay wait I forgot how I did this the last time I removed this annoying [ __ ] H so this   
has three dots in the top which makes it easy edit dashboard ah hide energy is it this one huh no all areas yes submit it's actually H  
oh this is this is oh [ __ ] me this is actually quite annoying show code editor F show visual editor this is even worse living room    
submit come on how did I do this last time oh jeez huh right click no assist help me remove yeah you're as useful as Tesla okay I'll    
figure it out it will drive me insane it has to be here what if I'm like I don't understand what this has to do with anything it say    
edit dashboard but this doesn't do anything hide entities without area hide energy what does that do okay we have that but why how do I 
get rid of you oh my God this is so annoying how the [ __ ] do I make you go away do I do it from here I want the thermost out to be    
there I don't want this [ __ ] there oh jeez I think I have to go to each one and undo visible oh dear God actually never mind that     
doesn't even do it it doesn't even okay what if it's just disabled wait so now it's not even oh my God it just gives you an error now   
this just this is worse and worse holy okay there has to be a way around this this can't be this bad there's no way this is this bad    
dashboards okay here we go is it this can we have the overview oh no no no okay me a way to configure you cannot be edited from the UI  
you can hide it by setting another dashboard as a default okay can I make a new dashboard what if I make a new [ __ ] dashboard where's 
the where's the button to make a dashboard add a dashboard take control take control of your dashboard are you sure you you want to take
control yes okay that is the worst UI I've ever seen in my life [ __ ] my life no wonder closed door [ __ ] wins okay let's pretend that
didn't happen we'll edit that out so welcome to the Future where Lewis edited this out please God I hope I have the P I hope I edit that
out please pay attention while editing please pay attention while editing okay we're going to add to home we're going to hit add add    
card and we're going to go to our thermostat going name it second floor thermostat and that's that I have this little thing over here   
and you hit done up here and you have your thermostat isn't it awesome so once you're done you're G to you May hopefully you're not as  
stupid as I am and you'll figure it out so I can tell it to have the fan on all the time even if the compressor is not on or to turn the
fan off and the compressor is off I can say what mode it should be in hot or cool and I can change my temperature the cool part is if   
you look over here it'll even show you the history of what temperature it was set to at what time and what the temperature was at that  
time so this is the target temperature and and this is the existing temperature and you can see that for the entire day which is really 
cool like you get all these awesome graphs and stuff it's just it's it's very nice we also have to set up our IP addresses the same way 
that we set up our other servers so that home assistant never has its IP taken by something else just in case that we're caress or      
something stupid happens I thought I had this on camera but apparently I did not so when you're in home assistant you go to settings    
system Network and configure network interfaces now usually it's set to automatic where not going to set it to automatic we're going to 
change it to static and then you're going to set it up with an IP so I've already used 1921. 5.1 for my PFS router2 for my server do3   
for macal for calendar contacts and email so this one I'm going to set up to4 so the IP 192.168 5424 gateway address 192.168 5.1 the IP 
sensor uh pfSense router and 192.168 5.1 a DNS server after I do that I want this to be set up with a static mapping so in my DHCP      
server section of pfSense you go Services dhtp server and then you can add a static mapping which I did in the video that I thought was 
recording but if I didn't I can still just go down here you would hit add static mapping and the way that you would find the MAC address
because this is not a real piece of Hardware is I can go up here to Diagnostics and I can click on ARP table and when you click on ARP  
table it will show you a list of devices that are connected to this particular interface and you can see the MAC address of several of  
these devices so once I have all these Mac addresses over here except for the one I don't want to show up on camera here we go once I   
have all of these I can see home assistant I just told its IP 1 192.168 5.4 I know that that's it I know it host name is home assistant 
so this is this Mac address I can also look up the MAC address of the device by looking at the virtual machine manager but this is      
faster and more convenient for me since I'm already in the pfSense interface after that's done I can go here I would go add static      
mapping I would put in that IP address I would type in the IP over there that I want to be reserved for home assistant I could type in  
home assistant over there I would hit save at the end and now I know that nothing is going to take the IP address that belongs to home  
assistant and home assistant is always going to be in the same place now I'm going to show you how you would set this up on your phone  
once you're connected to your VPN you're set and you're able to connect to devices on your home network so I open up the home assistant 
application and I'm going to be greeted with the home assistant companion it's going to ask me to choose my server and I don't expect   
that it's going to be able to find it immediately because I am not on the same subnet I'm on the VPN subnet which is no big deal I'm    
going to type in the IP address that I set which is 192.168 do5 4 and it's going to ask that I connect and then it's going to say that I
cannot connect to home assistant and that's when I realized that I was being an idiot and I did not put the port in you're going to put 
the port in 8123 D sometimes we can be idiots in this case I still did not do what I was supposed to I'm supposed to put HTTP and that's
why I'm doing this video in real time because virtually everything's stupid that you probably think you you're the only one who's ever  
done I've done 18 times over I've been using home assistant almost since its Inception and I'm still an idiot that makes this mistake   
every single time I use it you can laugh I know I'm an idiot but at least at this point hopefully you don't feel like as much of an     
idiot too this is what I really used to like about doing the board repair videos and all that everybody thought you have to be a genius 
to do this and one of the things that I like showing people is that you can have as few brain cells as I do and still get everything    
done connect it's going to ask for my username and my password I have a very secure password Here enable location tracking no I would   
trust them with it though I'll be honest with you does anybody I would trust it's them and you can see my thermostat now if I wanted to 
edit this or I wanted to remove something the interface on the mobile interface is infinitely less shitty than the interface in the     
desktop you literally go edit dashboard and it's just immediately there you're not I'm not like clicking around and cursing for a long  
time I actually set up my dashboard initially from my Android phone not from the computer so that was the first time I ever tried doing 
stuff from the web interface and oh my God working touchcreen nonworking touchcreen [ __ ] nice home assistant has documentation for    
almost everything once you have set up the core once you have it connected to your network and once you have openvpn set up and once you
have the home assistant app running so that you can tunnel into your home network the sky the limit look up what devices are compatible 
with home assistant home assistant has an amazing Community they're all great people and they deserve donations they've done an         
excellent job of creating this piece of software they deserve and have earned your support in my opinion and I think they're great      
people the people that work on this really genuinely truly want to live in a world where we control our devices rather than our devices 
is controlling us they're doing this because they are passionate you have people that just want to give a middle finger in a m that's I 
here to every other company that tries to control every single aspect of how you use their products next up I'm going to show you how to
set up a home surve system that sends you alerts on your phone anytime somebody goes by the cameras that are around your house these are
going to be security cameras that use standard protocols like rtsp and oniv there's nothing wrong with having a cloud connected system  
but there's a lot wrong with having a cloud connected system that has to connect to somebody else's server in order for it to work      
security cameras used to be cameras where everything that you bought you could use it the way that you wanted to but now as this Cloud  
subscription economy nonsense has become more popular you'll have a lot of Cam that have to connect to somebody else's server in order  
for them to work and the problem with anything that has to connect to somebody else's server in order for it to work is that the person 
who owns that other server owns the camera not you whether we're talking about companies that advertise that you can view your camera   
and alerts on your phone and then take that functionality away unless you start paying them every month or buy a new camera or we're    
talking about companies that just disable the cameras or disable the storage altogether so that you can't even use them anymore this is 
something very common so I'm going to be showing you how to utilize cameras that connect to your server so that you can shoot choose how
to use them and get your alerts the way you please you can utilize these cameras any way you want you could use it with VLC if you      
wanted to use VLC to be able to view them you could use anything you want and that's what makes it beautiful the first thing I'm going  
to do is I'm going to show you how to set up a basic security camera and we're going to start with a security camera made by a company  
called hick Vision I'm choosing this camera the way that I choose my relationships I'm not choosing it because it's the best I'm        
choosing it because it's available and good enough this camera is a camera that I'm suggesting to you not because I think it's the best 
but because they're so ubiquitous and they're available virtually everywhere at insanely low prices almost every small business that I  
checked out in New York City used a hick Vision small hick Vision security camera because they're everywhere when a business goes out of
business and they do a liquidation sale you can often find them very cheap I have found these cameras I found lots of eight cameras for 
$150 that do 1080p or you know 3K video at 25 30 frames a second in high resol you know High bit rate they're not bad when you look on  
eBay you can get hick Vision cameras that are not bad for as low as 30 or $40 a piece and sometimes you'll find lots of them where      
somebody will sell eight of them for1 or $150 at business liquidation sales and auctions because these cameras are so popular and       
because you see them everywhere I want to show you how to set it up using this as an example there are other cameras if you want to buy 
the best of the best if you want to buy a camera that is the best of the best that's created by a really cool company I would would     
highly suggest that you buy cameras from a company called axis axis makes really really good cameras they make high quality stuff but   
you will pay for them this is a great camera everything that axis makes in my opinion is amazing and you're going to pay more for one   
access camera then you will for eight or 10 used hick vision cameras so the first thing we're going to do is try and set up a hick      
vision camera from scratch what good cameras do is they utilize DHCP when you first plug them into your network so they'll grab an IP   
address that your router provides it this is what good cameras do so for instance when you go to that section of pfSense called ARP     
table and it gives you a list of all the different IPS you'll be able to see when you connect your camera it'll just show up in this    
list one of the problems with cheaper cameras is they don't do this they'll often have some sort of weird static IP like 1 1920. z64    
that you won't even know what it is so because you don't even know what the IP it's trying to grab is or what subnet is trying to grab  
it from you you you have like no idea how to use it so Hig Vision cameras often do this [ __ ] and there's a special tool that you can  
download from their website that fixes this that that will fix it for you unfortunately this tool requires windows so I'm booting up a  
computer that is sandboxed I don't let this connect to do any or do anything this is a burner computer that I use for taking college    
math classes I didn't realize that if you take math in college that this explains it this explains why I was never very good at math but
they use something called Pearson View and every time I load up Pearson view from my college it show it it tells me that I cannot learn 
math if I don't use Windows if I use Linux I can't learn math and that explains it because I've been using Linux since 2002 and I've    
also had problems with math since I started high school so it's like wow I I finally figured out why I was bad anyway going back to this
this is going to be a program called sadp you can download it off of hick Visions website and this sadp program will find all of the    
cameras that are on your network and allow you to change the IP of those cameras to the proper camera to the proper IP so that's the    
installation file I'd already installed it so I'm going to start up sadp and when you start this up it's going to find the hick vision  
cameras on your network so when I look at pfSense you'll notice that it doesn't show me this 1 192.168 3 subnet camera but over here    
this program finds it and after this program finds it what I'm going to do is I am going to click the little check box over here here   
and I'm going to reset it enable DHCP now when you buy these cameras this is this is the thing sometimes these cameras will use         
passwords that uh that that the manufacturer or the the person doesn't even know so you may have to reset it by hitting a button that is
on the inside of the of the camera itself and once you hit that button inside the camera it will reset it to its default password which 
you can usually find by Googling that particular camera and oh oh [ __ ] okay let's see uh do I have my come on there we go so I'm going
to modify this to enable DHCP so what that means is that when I plug it into my network it is going to grab an IP address that that is  
supposed to be grabbing rather than whatever whatever it has over here so let's check back on my network and see if it shows up so that 
we can log into it and configure it as we please now it just showed this over here I'm I'm going to take a guess that that is my camera 
I can also go to status DHCP leases and it will show me all the devices that are connected so 18 is my burner desktop and I'm going to  
guess that9 is my little security camera there we go I'm going to log in and a lot of these passwords you'll just have to look on the   
box to find the camera or look at the manual or Google it depending on the camera that you got I'm going to configure this from scratch 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to Res set my interface just to show you how I would configure this from scratch so once you   
log into it you can set an IP address on your camera so let's say that I wanted to have a static IP of 192.168 5.19 I'm going to set    
that it's going to have a static IP so I know where to find it every time and then I'm also going to set a user for the camera or a user
password for it user management I can modify this and I can set the password as I'd like the password to be next up when you go to video
audio what I suggest you do is set the video encoding to h264 rather than h 265 because the software that we're going to be using when  
you're trying to view the stuff the Clips in a web browser or something else h265 is just a little bit buggy at this point and in my    
opinion the increase in quality is not yet worth it some people are going to disagree with that but just to keep things simple I would  
choose video encoding at h264 if you want to change the way the image looks you can mess with your display settings and everything else 
I'm not going to go over messing with all this stuff because it's going to be completely dependent on your environment like you know day
night switch backlight white balance you're going to choose this based on what makes sense for your particular use case it's it's it's  
not next up now that we know the username of our camera and we know the IP address of the camera we can now go on to set up our Network 
video recorder software that is going to be connecting to this camera but just before we do that I want to make sure that I can view the
stream inside of a program like VLC so I'm going to try to open my network stream and the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to the  
way I'm going to figure out what the actual address is of this camera stream is I can use a program called nmap so if you type what I   
would like to type in is nmap D- script and this is going to be in the guide that I provide you the written guide we're going to brute  
force it to find everything on Port 554 because this is our rtsp port and when I do this it's going to show me every single thing every 
single stream that this camera creates so I'll know what to copy and paste in here we go now there's a there's a bunch of different     
freaking streams here usually you're going to look for the one that's stream number one and stream number two with sdp at the end of it 
see usually stream one is going to be your high quality stream and stream two is going to be the lower quality stream and the reason    
it's good to have a lower quality stream in addition to your highquality stream is because our program is going to be viewing this all  
the time in order to detect certain types of objects so we don't want to tax our CPU by constantly viewing a 4K stream just to figure   
out if that's a cat or a dog or a human we want to use the high quality stream for when we're recording video but the lowquality stream 
is going to be for figuring out whether or not that's a human or a cat or a dog so that we're not taxing our CPU unnecessarily so when  
you look over here you will see the URLs for each of these streams and you're going to have to figure out which or which for your       
particular camera also these URLs over here you're going to have to modify just a little bit so the way you're going to modify this is  
you're going to take rtsp this this and you're going to put your username and then colon password like this and then you're going to put
an at and that is going to be how you're going to modify that URL so that you can actually see your video now once we've done that we're
going to test it inside of VLC to ensure that this actually works I'm going to hit play and it should eventually play your video stream 
there we go and now the next thing I want to do is I want to see if the lowquality stream loads as well so choose that and there we go  
now that I know what the URLs are for both of them I'm going to write them down inside of a notepad or a text file so that I have them  
for later reference next up we're going to set up a program called frig frig is a program that we are going to install using Docker now 
I'm not going to install frig in a virtual machine as I have everything else the reason I'm not going to install frig in a virtual      
machine is because frig allows you to connect an A Little Piece of Hardware accelerator so that it can do all that AI detection where it
figures out is that a dog a cat an elephant a person whatever else but that doesn't work as well in a virtual machine as it does when   
it's just straight up running on the host system so I'm going to be installing that on the server rather than installing it on a virtual
machine on the server this is going to be installed in a docking container and we're going to modify the configuration just a little bit
so that it runs the way I would like it now we're going to be sshing into our server computer this is the main server which we set up at
192.168 5.2 or you can type in Happy Cloud . home. arpa at yeah boom password yay we're in now we are going to be installing Docker     
first stop sometimes I'm so lazy with moving my hand that I'm actually I'm not using my track ball to copy and paste from the written   
manual to yeah to this which is which I really should be doing to make my life easy I like having a track point on a ThinkPad I'm kind  
of used to that I miss the I know they make a desktop keyboard but it doesn't have a palm rest and it doesn't have the little legs on it
so it just does it's not ergonomic the way it is on a standard thing pad next up we install Docker composed plugin remember the little  
dasy tells it to install without asking me yes I'd rather hit my y later than my y now next up I'm going to make sure that I don't need 
to run my commands as root I'm going to add my user to the docker user group and because I'm a hipster instead of typing my username    
Lewis I'm going to type an environment variable forgot to do it as super user see look at how cool that is that's me next up I'm going  
to create a directory for my programs so I'm going to go downloads see download oh I'm going Delirious make a directory for my programs 
and then I'm going to clone the frig repository I'm going to download frig now I'm going to do something that's a little controversial  
here I'm going to use the uh I'm going to use the old version of frig rather than the new version of frig and I'm going to show you why 
once I'm done installing them the new version of frig in my opinion is absolutely horrific and it's it's just it takes a good user      
interface and it completely destroys it for no good reason and and I can't use that so we're I'm going to download an old version I'll  
show you the differences between the old and the new version so that you can decide for yourself which one you want to use but I'm not  
going to use the the new version because it's horrible and it's not made for humans it's made for people that that yeah just it's it's  
it's it's bad it's really really bad next up once we're in that directory we're going to edit our docker-compose file this is going to  
be the file that sets up everything and tells us what to install so the way I'm going to edit this first thing I'm going to do is I'm   
going to go to the actually we're just going to use a different file Al together than this so I hit control K and I use Nano as my text 
editor and I just hit control K and keep it down and I'm going to paste in the this file that I'm going to show you so this image is    
going to be the last good version of frig I'm not going to download the stable of the latest version I'm downloading 0.3.2 now the what 
I've done here is I've separated the database directory from the storage directory I don't I don't need my my database is going to be   
really small so I'm going to want to store that on my solid stay drive but my Clips I mean this may be taking up hundreds upon hundreds 
of gigabytes and it's going to be writing to it constantly I don't want that direct I want that on a hard drive and I want the          
flexibility to choose what hard drive I want that on later so I have a different directory for the database than I do for the storage   
and I'll show you how to change this later so this means that the storage directory inside the frig directory is going to map to Media  
frig inside frig and the database directory inside our frig directory is going to map to slata DB directory inside of frig's container  
this is going to run on Port 5000 and this is for the new version the newer versions allow you to have a user authentication so on Port 
5000 it's not even going to ask for a user and a password whereas in Port 8971 it does with the newer version so there's a way of       
getting around this so that you can have a username and password on the old version and I'm going to show you that at the end so once   
you're done setting up your file like this this this file should work fine for you you're going to save it and then after that we're    
going to create a configuration file I am going to provide you with a template configuration file you're going to go and if you want to 
use their template configuration file you can go into config it's going to give you this configuration file it's a config example my    
video recording died on me so let's go back to where I was so when you go in when you're in frot you go to the config directory and     
you're going to see a configuration file that's already there but the problem with this configuration file is that it doesn't really    
have most of the settings that you're going to want a configuration file to have and the problem with these is that a valid             
configuration file is going to going to look something like this I'm going to just copy and paste mine in there and just remove some of 
the passwords and stuff like that so that you can see what a v what a config file looks like and just get an idea when I say that yamama
files are hell what it is that I mean so this is called the yaml file yes look at this so the first thing that I like to have in the top
of my file that's not in the standard configuration is we are going to have the URL or the domain or the IP address of our home         
assistant computer over here the home assistant computer is going to be the computer that's going to be sending us alerts so that needs 
to get information from frig every time that it detects something so that that's one of the changes from the normal file now I'm        
providing you a template because these files are held to work with if I have this instead of this it won't work I'm not kidding it's    
that annoying so you're going to have to change the username the password the IP address the URL of your camera and you're also going to
have to change what it is you want to detect you may not want to detect a giraffe a zebra an elephant or a mouse and you're probably not
going to want these masks here you may want to delete the lines that have masks in them you may want to you're going to want to change  
the threshold for detecting certain items but I'm providing you with a file that works at its core so that you can at least I think it's
easier if you edit a file that you you know Works rather than have to make your own from scratch and that'll be in the written version  
of the guide so we're saving our database to a separate directory then we're saving our videos and it's going to connect to our home    
assistant computer up there that's going to be the URL of whatever you not the that's going to be the IP address of the home assistant  
computer and this will become obvious why I've CH why this is there once we set up home assistance for alerts so let me just put my real
file in there now because this is the file that does doesn't have any passwords in it that are real not that it really matters you'd    
have to hack into my home network to be able to see my cameras anyway but and that what's the worst you could see you could see my fish 
once you're done over there with making the config file you're going to go back into the frig directory and you're going to run Docker  
compose up and it's going to grab all of the files for the container which means that that's why it's going to be lower the first time  
around and then after that when you run Docker compose up it will just simply run frig it now remember you're going to want to type-d at
the end so that when you close the terminal it still runs when I first run a program that I've composed with Docker the reason I like to
run it without the- D is because I can see on the terminal without having to look like type something else and see logs exactly what's  
going on when it first starts I like to see that when it first starts so it's giving me a configuration validation error which is to be 
expected I think I made a mistake by having the version specified at the end of the file no big deal so all right I edited my file to   
get rid of the version I commented out version at the end of it because it's not happy since I set it to a different version than what  
it actually is I'm using the old version 0.13 not 0.14 and now it is working it's running everything so I'm going to show you what the  
web interface looks like once I've installed it now just because I don't want to have a blank setup in there I took the Liberty of      
copying over my database and my files from my working install over here so that you can see it we're going to visit the URL in the      
browser 192.168 5.2 which is our server and then colon 5000 and then over there you can see my cameras you can see what I've got and I  
even have my little fishy camera over here let me show you why it is I made the choice to default this guide to installing an old       
version a frig rather than a new version I'm not here to tell you how to run your system I'm just here to to show you a template of     
what's available but this is your journey you can run whatever you want so in the written guide I will show you what to write in the    
docker compose file so that you could run the new version or the old version depending on your preferences I'm going to show you why I  
think the new version is horrible by showing you how nicely the old version works and then how horribly the new version works and you   
decide for yourself if you want to use the new version and just torture yourself the way I did when I wanted to install gtu from a stage
one tball back in 2004 so I can be cool so let's show you what the old version looks like the web interface in the old version it says  
over here the moment you log in everything is laid out for you cameras settings store config system events so if I want to see what     
happened I can just read it over here events clear plain text I click on events and I can scroll through and I can see all of the       
different events that it recorded now what's great about this is that I can scroll back and see events for as long as I want I can see  
stuff from a week ago two weeks ago and I can so customize it by clicking the calendar over here the calendar will say today yesterday  
last seven days this month last month or I can hit custom range and when I have custom range I can click this date I can click that date
and I'll see everything from October 1st through October 3rd it's very easy intuitive and simple to use and also you can see what it    
detected so it says person car person car so I I know what it's detecting and more importantly I can see the confidence that it has that
that's a person the confidence that that's a car so it says over here it thinks that that is a car with 71 % confidence see that 71%    
confidence this allows me to set up my configuration file let's say I set up my config file to show a car when you are 71% confident    
that you're a car and that tells me it's 71% confident that's a car that tells me that I may miss seeing cars because I'm right on the  
borderline I've said 71% is my threshold it's 71% certain that's a car that gives me a a signal that maybe I should go to my config file
and lower the threshold for a car I have all that information available to me now let's say that I learned that my my nextdoor neighbor 
got murdered by somebody with a blue shirt and I go through I can easily scroll through because I'm like oh I remember somebody came by 
my house with a blue shirt to deliver food maybe that is the murderer so I can scroll down and I can see that they're right here like I 
may have not saved this clip because I didn't know that this person was going to be a murderer I didn't save it I didn't starve it just 
whatever but now that I know that somebody who is a brunette brunette woman with a a baggy blue t-shirt and thin jeans killed somebody  
okay I can scroll through it and find it I don't remember the day were here but it's very easy to find let me show you what this is like
in the new web interface that they thought was actually a good idea to implement watch what happens when I go over to the new web       
interface this is with version 14 now it has some cool features where it'll automatically start autle playing things and well doing     
weird [ __ ] like this I don't know what the [ __ ] it thinks it's doing there but if I go over here well which one is events which one 
is set like what is what so we have um an eyeball with a sideways [ __ ] eyebrow over here we have the play button for review we have   
plus what am I what am I adding with plus like what does this even do like why just why I can add a camera group uh like I don't I don't
want no like you used to have this with a nice little drop down so let's say I go over to review this is funny so I can review the clips
from the past 24 hours how do I know how confident I was that this was a car is it 70% confident 80% confident 60% I don't know I have  
to click through somewhere else to find that so there's less information available immediately now you may notice that it only goes to  
October 10th where's all my other Clips I have to click on the calendar up here to find them now can I if let's say I click October 10th
and then I click October 2 it there's no way to set a range I can't set a range I can only view one [ __ ] day at a time which means    
that if I want to find that person that may have been the murderer and I don't know which day they were here I have to click on October 
10th and then scroll through everything but I have to click away from the calendar because the calendar blocks this so then I get to go 
back to the calendar and click on October 9th and then I get to click away and then I get to scroll through everything I somebody       
actually this is what [ __ ] me up inside somebody it's not that they have a bad user interface cuz it's open source software they have 
a limited budget I get I have sympathy for that it's that they had a good interface and somebody thought let me you know what it would  
somebody's actually thought it would be a good idea to take this amazing UI that works and [ __ ] destroy it for no for literally no    
good reason and wait you see how this is in a phone cuz man if you think this sucks in a computer oh my God so we're going to look at   
this on a smart smart phone and see how this works uh with with the old version and then with the new version so with the old version   
when I go to events oh man this is so easy to scroll through right here like you you can scroll through everything and all the          
information is right there I can easily go to Old events if I want to change what is showing up at that particular time I click on the  
calendar I can click custom range and I can just choose my date range and it works now watch what happens with the new version it like  
you believe it or not this actually does get worse okay this one has reverse proxy set up but that's a certificate so you have some     
interesting stuff where it'll show you the camera like [ __ ] playing in real time so first things first where do I click for events you
have these buttons at the bottom that are almost the same color as the background so let's say I I could let's say I click here for     
events right it gets even worse so where's the where's the calendar where's the calendar like is it is this the calendar no it only     
shows me one day is is this the calendar no is this the I don't even know what the [ __ ] this is like I have a little yellow vertical  
Soundwave now maybe I can go in settings wait so when you click on the gear it gives you the settings but then there's another settings 
menu inside of settings and above all you have to click on the other settings menu cuz there's two gears there's two settings menus and 
then when you click on this settings menu you get calendar so think oh my God maybe they gave me a back but no you can only click one   
day at a time you can't you can't select multiple days and then when you click here well how do I how do I leave it I go over here and  
now you see the loading time you see the lag on this [ __ ] look at this like look at how you you'll see it's going to take like five or
10 seconds to load October 2nd and this is what Eli the computer guy was talking about is that if you have the wrong camera software    
even if you have the best cameras in the world it doesn't matter because if it's so painful to find a video you will let that person who
stole 3,000 of stuff out of your house rob you rather than you're okay with it you won't even report it to the police because it's      
literally not worth $3,000 to you or the potential of getting your stuff back to have to deal with this [ __ ] this is painful like this
this is so bad anyway like [ __ ] this like Fu [ __ ] [ __ ] that so so we're going to be using the old version of frig and again if you
want to use the new version it finally loaded there we go it finally loaded if you want to use the new version of frig then like by all 
means torture yourself but my default is going to be using the old version of frig because I'm trying to I'm trying to be nice to myself
you know my therapist is saying be nice to yourself like you know be kind to yourself part of that is not using software that tortures  
me next up we're going to set up home assistance so that every time somebody walk by your camera you get an alert on your phone this is 
something that's not set up by default in frig and it doesn't have that capability but home assistant does and it integrates with frig  
very well it would have been easier for us to set all this up if we installed frig within home assistant but the problem with doing that
is that means that we have to use the new version of frig which in my opinion is even though it's easier to install it's more miserable 
to use and with software the freedom that I care about more than anything is something called free as in free time free as in free time 
means that it doesn't take me 20 minutes to find a video of a crook that stole something from me it only takes 30 seconds because I have
a nice user interface and when you use software when software allows you to save time people are willing to get abused they're willing  
to use ring doorbell they're willing to be spied on by Google they're willing to live in a closed garden with apple they're willing to  
have a camera where the manufacturer can literally turn off their ability to use it or just double the price and not allow them to      
connect to it locally just to save time so when I'm making this guide I don't want to make a generic guide that is that takes 30 minutes
and says here's how to install like nextcloud and home assistant then you're done I'm giving you a guide I want to make a guide where   
everything is actually better than the closed sore solution so that you actually want to use this software so it feels good to use it so
let's go over to home assistant and get started that you can either go to 1 192.168 5.4 and 8123 Port 8123 or you can go to home        
assistant like this. home. arpa 8123 so remember when we were setting up static mappings for everything when we were adding static      
mappings as we went every time you added a static mapping IP address and host name this gets registered in the DNS resolver in pfSense  
so what that means is if you go to system advanc networking if you're using the proper DHCP server not the one that they keep trying to 
tell you to use you it all of this will get you have an option to add everything to the DNS resolver as soon as you add a static mapping
so in services and DNS resolver these two options over here are going to save you a lot of time register DHCP leases in DNS resolver    
register DHCP static mappings in the DNS resolver after that if you go to system in general setup this domain here is what you type     
clinty why you running away boy my catch just run away once you type in home assistant up here you're going to type in that and then you
type in dot the domain it will bring you to where you were going well Le I forgot to put the port there it's A123 so one Prett here     
we're going to install four things we're going to install HCS which is going to allow us to install some other stuff we're going to     
install mosquito broker mosquito broker is going to receive messages from frig so every time somebody walks by a camera we're going to  
tell frig to send a message to home assistant it's going to receive that message we're going to set it up with an mq uh and mosquito    
client that is going to receive those messages from the mosquito broker we installed on home assistant and then we're going to install a
uh a freeg get integration plugin that is going to set set up automations so that every time somebody walks by it's going to            
automatically send an alert to our phone instead of having to write miserable yaml files to do this we're going to be installing        
something called blueprint and importing blueprints that allow us to just add a camera from frig without having to write Edie yaml yaml 
nonsense so I'm going to try to make this as easy as possible for you with regards to user interface stuff so let's get started there so
first things first is we're going to install a HS so we're going to go to the website that and I will include this website in the       
written guide once you get here you go to OS supervised because we installed home assistant OS to add the HCS add on repository click   
this link now make sure that this link your instance URL it must be your home assistant URL sometimes it does local and when it's loal  
it won't load because a lot of routers normal routers consumer ones. local is your local domain pfSense is different. home. ARA so      
whatever the URL is here make sure that that loads in home assist your home assistant instance or else it's not going to work we click  
update open this page in home assistant we open it missing add-on repository you click add now after that go to the documentation page  
to add it uh and you're going to click add and get HCS add-on click install start the add-on navigate to the add-on logs and we're going
to restart home assistant and then follow every step over here so once this is done start on boot we're going to go to settings go there
restart home assistant restart home assistant restart home assistant now once we've done this you're going to go to you're going to     
clear your browser cache which is going to require that you log in again so in Firefox I click on those three lines at the top I'm going
to go to history clear recent history everything you know I'm sh I don't really need to clear everything I'm not going to clear history 
site data I'll just clear temporary cache files and Pages now I'm going to go back to home assistant go settings devices and services   
we're going to add an integration hacs a wait uh did you you install refresh refresh okay maybe I should just clear everything yeah     
we'll just you know what to be safer I'm going to go settings I'm going to re reboot the entire system just to be safe click that       
advanced options reboot entire system and I'll just clear my BR I'll clear cookies and everything too clear recent history we're going  
to clear everything there we go and we're going to log back into home assistant it's going to take a little a few seconds to reboot I   
can actually see my virtual machine status here it is rebooting it's a good little home assistant it's a good little home assistant I   
talk to my home assistant the way I talked to my cat I like my k Kitty but I also like my home assistant it looks like it's booted so   
we're going to log in home assistant is starting but not everything is available yet no big deal settings add-ons hacks start hacks     
devices and services add integration H where are you here we go so we go to settings add-ons add-on store HCS get hack start you bastard
okay I'm going to restart you one more time restart you one more time I will clear my cash one more time that's that's the open source  
experience experience right there and how about this I'm going to do that I'm G to close my web browser too ah doing it live because    
it's fun this way okay I was being impatient so I kept restarting it but after hitting start over there when you go to log it you have  
to restart home assistant but it's downloading a zip file and it's doing work and the instructions did say to look at log and I did not 
look at log so yeah my bad so it never actually fully installed uh so don't be impatient like me if you're impatient then this is once  
you're done click log okay now we go settings we are going to restart home assistant and clear my cash again going to clear recent      
history going to clear cach and then I'm going to go overview reload home assistant is starting not everything may be available yet     
there we go okay settings add-ons hacks start look at our log great now we're going to go to settings devices and services and we are   
going to add an integration you go h a Cs and then it we'll be there if you don't wait for it to finish because you're impatient like me
it won't show up there I know how to access home assistant logs blah blah blah submit now you take the code go over to GitHub I'm going 
to log into GitHub I think you have to have a GitHub account to do this no big deal it doesn't cost you any money continue authorize now
once this is authorized you can close that browser Tab and go back to where you are here and once that's done you add this to an area   
like living room and then you have hacks over here which is nice and cool now I'm going to visit the frig home assistant add-ons page   
wait a second this is the frigate home assistant integration now do not click this giant blue button because this will literally just   
bring you back to this page you're going to click download in the bottom right corner so we are going to install the latest version of  
this integration and even though we are using an older version of frig this will actually work just fine now we already downloaded it no
okay and after doing that we are going to configure it go back to hacks pending restart settings res start required the issue is        
repaired like that vocabulary there we're going to wait for it to start up again because I'm impatient I'm going to hit enter over and  
over again because that is what I do so now go to settings devices and services add integration and we have frig and over here we can   
enter our URL now remember we're not installing frig onto home assistant to be run inside of it we are adding frig as an integration now
we have to put in the URL for our frigate installation which is going to be 192168 5.2 or since we set this up in pfSense with a static 
mapping happy cloud. home. arpa which is going to be 192.168 5. to which is the address of our server and then it failed connect because
I forgot to turn it on okay so we're going to we get it let's go back to that window and turn it back on Docker compose up- D remember  
we don't need to lose our our terminal anymore I only run it without the dashd in the beginning because I wanted to see if any error    
messages popped up as I started it and I wanted to see what they were after you connect to your frig installation by entering the URL of
it and the port which is 5,000 then outside house and I am going to label it outside house outside house I don't get like this labels   
descriptions names there's so many different ways to that's alas is I haven't really like gotten uh as familiar with that as I should   
that's but yeah outside house I'm going to add all these all these cameras what the hell FR can be outside house too and I hit finish   
now once that's done and I have that all set up I can start adding Integrations and in order to start adding Integrations from like     
grabbing stuff from frig I have to install something that's going to accept my messages from frig so we are going to go for settings    
add-ons add-on store misquito broker and mosquito broker is going to allow us to receive those messages from frig install we're going to
make sure this is set up to start on boot and we're going to start it now this is going to receive the messages from Fri but after it   
receives it home assistant has to like do all the services in home assistant have to actually do something with those messages so we're 
going to go devices and services and we're now going to add mq uh TT or mqtt or whatever it was here we go and this is going to get     
added because this is going to receive the messages from mosquito broker we click it submit it's going to automatically configure it to 
match all the settings in mosquito broker so I don't have to mess with it beautiful that's lovely see no configuration needed and well  
open source moment when I click configure so we can go settings devices and services and you'll see mqtt is right there and again the   
open source moment but again it autoc configured so who really cares if the configure button doesn't work I clicked it as an entity and 
yeah so I have several different configure buttons and then most of them don't work except for that button but as long as it autoc      
configured I don't careful your configure buttons didn't work you can be as open sourcy as you want there next up we want to add        
automations and if we want to add automations we go to settings automations and scenes and we would have to uh we would have to to um go
through this and we're going to add yamoo files and other things that are very miserable but I don't want to do those things because I  
want life to be simpler so there's something called blueprints over here that makes life very easy so we're going to go to over here    
this is the Fret home assistant blueprints add stable again the loal thing we're going to use the URL that works make sure that the URL 
in here when you go to a new tab and hit enter it must log you into your home assistant or else this will not work hit save open page   
and home assistant import a blueprint this is a frig blueprint import blueprint now watch what happens when we click on this blueprint  
instead of having to add yaml files you can just click and then it has all your cameras imported from frig so back door closeup I can   
click back door closeup now for devices I am going to have to add my mobile device so that I actually get notifications so on my mobile 
device I'm going to log back into home assistant because uh I have not logged back in home assistant so on the mobile device I'm going  
to just open home assistance the way that I had it opened earlier when I set it up with the thermostat I actually wiped home assistance 
because I went back to using the version of it that I I wanted to use for my own home system I'm going to enter my address manually do  
my phone is actually connected to a different network altogether forgot about that when you add your address it'll be sometimes it I    
think gets mad at you if you don't add it with HTTP connect welcome going to type in my hypers secure password this is this entire thing
is going to be deleted and off the internet before get away from you stupid book before this video is published so no big deal connect  
to home assistant I'm going to call this Lewis oh I don't need location track get away you piece of [ __ ] bug continue enable          
notifications that's very important need notifications or else this whole system is not going to work beautiful now my phone has been   
added as a device so I'm going to reload this page leave editor frig notifications we're going to click it again I'm going to choose a  
camera I can choose back door closeup mobile device Lewis phone and then there are some settings that you can configure notification    
customizations title of the notification uh so I can label Intruder Intruder home alert I can tell it to send it even if my phone is on 
silent by changing the notification type critical notification true just like anybody get that that uh that that critical warning at    
4:00 a.m. saying like man in blue shirt in jeans Beat cop in this town with like 2,000 people thank you let me get my [ __ ] Batmobile  
and go like s [ __ ] idiot there's this one [ __ ] jackass that made sure that every single person in the state of Texas like they got  
over 30 million people to turn off alerts alerts in their phone emergency alerts like [ __ ] any so name frig uh I'm going to call this 
backo cam notification backdoor cam notification rename and there we go back automations back door cam notification now we're going to  
have some fun after that we're going to go over to frot and make sure that it's sending messages to our home assistant device so when   
you go you go over to frig remember that's installed on Happy cloud. home. arpa Port 5000 you go over here to the three dots you're     
going to go over to config and over here the host is going to be home assistant. home. arpa or 192.168 5.4 it's up to you port is going 
to be 1883 that's where it's going to send messages over user is going to be Lewis password is going to be whatever your home Assistant 
password was and there you go there you go now I'm going to go over here to the three three bars we're going to go over to cameras and  
that was a me when I went to feed my fishy so let's go over there I'm going to go downstairs and let's see if an alert shows up on my   
phone so I have my phone recording so you'll be able to see if there is an alert also you can probably see that my phone battery is 8%  
watching this PBS documentary is talking about how if your phone is less than it's charge less than like 38% that means that you're less
likely to pay your your loans back very interesting was even talking about how yeah to get that light on okay let's see how good this is
if I don't have walk outside I have my light turned off just to see how good this is and as you can see it says Intruder home alert nice
ain't it so there you have it I got an intruder alert on my phone so now not only can you see when something has gone by your house not 
only can you configure it so that you only see the specific objects that you want to see but you can even get an alert on your phone the
way you would with fancy schmancy Cloud systems and it's yours you own it this is so much better than motion detection motion detection 
like a leaf falls by and it alerts you you're not going to get false alerts with this and you can set it up exactly the way you want you
own it somebody else doesn't with that we're going to move on to the next section of the guide I hope this was helpful for you last     
thing we have to do is make this secure because right now this setup is ridiculously insecure anybody that is on your local network any 
Tom Dicker Harry can go and go 192.168 5.2 colon 5000 and they have administrative access there's no login web interface there's no like
user password authentication everybody who logs into this can edit your config they can see all of your recordings and they can hit     
delete on them that's not a great thing now I know you may be thinking I don't really care about that they'd have to break through my   
VPN in order to get into this from the outside world and people I let into my house I trust plus I have a guest Network so when they    
connect to Wi-Fi the guest Network can't connect to the Lan [ __ ] your guest Network seriously [ __ ] your guest Network you're you're 
never going to use that thing that uh the guest Network on a Wi-Fi hotspot gets used as often as as a treadmill in your house for       
exercise like treadmills are used as clothes racks and guest networks don't get used at all here's why you connect to your G you connect
to your normal Network every day which you remember the password to however your guest Network you don't remember the password to       
because you don't use it every day you set it up once three years ago and then when your uncle or your cousin or somebody shows up or   
the plumber and they ask for the Wi-Fi password guest Network you forgot it so to avoid an awkward moment where you spend 5 or 10       
minutes resetting it or figuring out how to do that you give them the password to your normal Network totally forgetting that this is   
completely insecure and that you have something on your land that doesn't require authentication now that that is a bad thing because   
that means that anybody who is in your house who can either plug into your network or anybody in your house that can that has Wi-Fi can 
get access to this system and literally delete all your recordings so what we're going to do is a few things firstly we are going to    
make it so that you're not going to connect on Port 5000 we are going to connect we're going to do something called the reverse proxy so
when you you're going to go to frig on 192.168 5.2 colon 443 for https or you can go on Port 80 we're going to do it in your web browser
so if you type in http1 192.168 5.2 or https 192.168 5.2 it is is going to bring you to a screen that requires a login you're going to  
have to Lo in then what we're going to do is we are going to block access to every computer on the network to Port 5000 except for the  
home assistant computer usually what people would do is they would tell frig only listen on Local Host and then they would set up nginx 
to uh be able to listen on all the interfaces and take traffic from Port 80 or 443 and they would add an authentication that would be a 
little bit less complex to do because we wouldn't need firewall rules and that would be a to a great thing to do if home assistants is  
running on the same machine as frig but it's not it's running in a VM so I'm I'm not running frig inside the VM because that means that 
I have to use the new version of frig which I don't want to do so what we're going to do is we are going to add a couple of firewall    
rules and I'm also going to set up ngx as a reverse proxy so that when somebody wants to connect to frig they're going to require a     
username and a password to do so however your home assistance integration which only asks for you URL remember when we had that part    
where it asked us for a URL for our home assistant it never said username and password over there that will still work uh so this will  
be more secure all around so the first thing that we're going to do is we are going to set up a reverse proxy and ensure that the       
reverse proxy actually works so let's get started with that so we are going to install a program called ngx that is a nice little uh    
nice little web server so let's analyze what it is we want to accomplish before we get started [ __ ] with stuff the first first thing  
we want to do is make sure that when we try to connect to frig it does not work so when I go to 192.168 at 5.2 5000 I should not see [  
__ ] I should not be able to see events I should not be able to see my cameras uh the second thing is that home assistant should be able
to see frig because we're going to allow it frig needs to be able to see home assistant when we go to settings devices and services frig
at entry I want this to see my cameras I should be able to type 1 192 168 55 to and see everything on that that should still work and   
the third thing is when I go to https uh one I to 165 to two I should have something running there there should actually be a service   
and it should ask me for a password so this is going to be fun so first things first we are going to use IP tables here I don't like IP 
tables I use it as absolutely minimally as necessary because I'm not that smart I'll just be honest with you anytime I have to use IP   
tables I have to spend 10 minutes or 20 minutes on stack overflow trying to understand what everything is it's not made for humans it's 
made with people with double my IQ maybe triple probably triple if I'm being honest with you but the reason we have to use it is because
we're running frig and Docker which means our ufw rules are going to get overridden and ignored ufw is a firewall that's made for humans
and people that have my intelligence probably at least like maybe 40 IQ points above me but 40 IQ points above me rather than you know  
my IQ cubed so this is going to be good for https it's going to allow establish connections this one is going to make sure that Local   
Host meaning like my computer that computer running frig will be able to connect to Port 5000 on itself we cannot block ngx which is my 
web server there from attaching to frig on Port 5000 next we're going to allow home assistant on Port 5000 so this is going to make sure
that 192.168 5.4 can attach to Port 5000 next up we are going to block everything else everybody else can get [ __ ] so nobody else and 
we're going to make sure that Docker doesn't [ __ ] with me and try to undo all my [ __ ] so let's let's see if this works uh before we 
get started doing any reverse proxy fancy stuff so first things first is when I try to load frig again it better not work okay I'm      
clicking it and it's not opening I'm opening it in a new tab and it doesn't open yes beautiful doesn't load next up home assistant      
should be able to load Fri so remember when I go just see you remember where I'm where I'm going because I don't expect you to remember 
everything thing if you're not following along with the written guide and home assistant I go settings devices and services frig at     
entry I should be able to put in my IP here and it should be able to see all my cameras device is already configured [ __ ] okay so I'll
just [ __ ] delete it delete it and I'll just reconfigure it add entry 1 2168 5.2 and it sees all my cameras so this is doing its job   
like so so my frig plug-in inside of Home assistant is able to connect but other devices are not able to connect now the third thing is 
going to be adding the reverse proxy so that we can relog into frig but log into frig as uh as somebody who has to authenticate with a  
username and a password so to do that we are going to install nginx and also let's just make these firewall rules persistent because if 
you don't make the F wall rules persistent then when you reboot it won't work so like a year and a half ago I'm never going to forget   
this I almost never reboot my server I didn't make the IP rules persistent so since I didn't make the IP rules persistent when I        
rebooted nothing worked and I had I I I had no idea that it was because of Ip table stuff and that that wasted about two hours of my    
life so in let's just make sure iptables-persistent is installed I believe this should be because we set this up we made our Bridge     
interface so that's going to BU bother me remove yeah that my OCD that'll bother me okay so we're going to use this net filter          
persistent save what this does is it makes sure that my rules will last across reboot and just because I'm used to things [ __ ] with me
I'm going to make sure that nothing that I just did sto my rules from working okay frig it reload it doesn't work lovely our rules are  
telling us to get [ __ ] as they should next up we're going to install everything that's needed to set up a reverse proxy so ngx is a   
lovely little web server and we have the Apache 2 utils that's going to be for setting up the password authentication the first thing   
we're going to do after this is we're going to create a self-signed SSL certificate remember that this computer never connects to the   
Internet so I can't use let's encrypt or anything else to make a certificate so uh ah you didn't you didn't see that did you okay       
installing ngx was apt install ngx Apache to utils Dy and then yeah this is for to make my SSL certificate I I have to use self-signed  
because this doesn't connect to the Internet so you don't really have to fill this out it doesn't matter nobody's going to see this but 
you Rosman camera group common name home Happy cloud. home. arpa get [ __ ] and then we're going to create our diff Helman group doesn't
know how [ __ ] pretentious that [ __ ] sounds all right uh let's make our password file my name is Lewis Lois so everybody [ __ ] calls
me on YouTube I can't spell my damn name so we're going to type the password that we want to use to log in next up we're going to create
a configuration file for our reverse proxy now we have sites available and sites enabled so you're going to create it in sites available
uh now when you go to a web server they have like 15 1500 15,000 different websites running on one IP you don't have like [ __ ] one web
you don't have one IP for each website so the way this works is you have all these different files for all the different websites that  
are running on a server so if you connect to a certain IP you have to connect with the domain name in order for it to actually direct   
you to the right place so this we're going to listen on Port 80 and as long if you go to try to get to Port 80 and you try to get a port
80 connecting to this IP or this domain name happy cloud. home. arpa it will send you to the https version which is the more secure more
better at Port 443 on Port 443 if you've gone to happy cloud. home . arpa or 19216 5.2 these are the SSL certificates that going to show
up in your browser these are the security protocols just a bunch of wankery it is going to send you to frig which is on our Local Host  
running on Port 5000 but for you to see it you're going to be seeing it through this on Port 443 and you need your username and password
without username and password it will tell you to get [ __ ] which is exactly what we want so now we're going to create a siming from E 
ngx sites available frot to the sites enabled which is uh size- enabled now we installed nginx let's see if that configuration file     
works it is saying that it doesn't work so I probably [ __ ] something up very basic available oh I didn't put a [ __ ] yeah of [ __ ]  
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] you too okay ngx DT it's good we're going to tell ngx to start up with the system wait no no no God
damn it I'm getting garious pseudo system CTL enable in GX and Z assistant TL restart ngx yes we are started and we are good and just in
case yeah makes me feel more better I didn't need to do that but it makes me feel better and that's what really counts when we're doing 
a a six to 10 hour long [ __ ] video now making sure everything works when I go to frig Port 5000 tells me to get [ __ ] when I go to   
frig on Port 80 it redirects me to https lovely so it's not going to stick you see it's not sticking me with Port 80 now let's see if it
works when I connect with my domain name which is happy cloud. home. arpa yeah look at that isn't that beautiful https SSL and it       
requires username and password so there you go got frig it set up it's going to send notifications to your Android phone it's going to  
record stuff properly you have a weet interface that doesn't suck balls and it's nice and secure using openvpn to connect in fully      
encrypted nobody else is going to be able to get access to this outside your network and even if your brother-in-law your cousin or     
somebody that you [ __ ] hate maybe it's your husband or your wife who the [ __ ] knows 50% of the marriages end in divorce in America  
probably because they deleted the their configuration to their frig server they all get told to get [ __ ] and with that we move on to  
the next part of this video and I get to turn these [ __ ] lights off take off these damn sunglasses yes yes why are you wearing        
sunglasses indoors you try staring at a camera in six hours and tell me how you like it all right on to the next part next up I'm going 
to be setting up a virtual machine that's going to manage all the services that I use with my Android phone that I otherwise would be   
using Google for I'm not going to be using one service I'm going to be using three separate Services because I want to use the service  
that's best for the job it's going to be a little bit of an Ecentric setup based on many years of experience trying to use one tool for 
a job and realizing that there are many pitfalls of it I would usually use Google Drive to back up all the files from my phone to my    
server for that I'm going to be using sync thing I would usually use Google keep and Google docs to be able to read documents and also  
have notes I love the way Google keep works it's a nice little program and I like having being able to have all these different little  
little Post-it notes and be able to label them the way that I want and have different folders for them I like being able to write down  
things insanely quickly and and then be able to organize them later nextcloud notes actually does a good job of that we're going to have
nextcloud for doing notes syn thing is just a file syncing thing it doesn't have a way to view photos and nexcloud has a way to view    
photos but it's incredibly slow it lacks machine learning capabilities I can't do the thing where I say I want to see every single      
picture of lwis I want to see every single picture of Jessa every single picture of my stepmom and I can't do the thing where I search  
cat on chair or red cat on chair and it shows me a red cat on chair from 8 years ago immediately image also allows me to transcode video
proxies which nexcloud doesn't further image loads the original photo faster than nexcloud loads the pre-rendered thumbnail I'm not     
kidding so we are going to be using the best tool for each job so the first thing we're going to get started with before we do any of   
this is the thing that I said I was not going to do which is show you how to set up X11 VNC think of X11 VNC like team viewer if he was 
even slower if you could imagine that but it's open source so it's allowed to be even slower I don't want to sit in that little room    
downstairs anymore and I said I was going to do the virtual machine stuff the gooey but I I really don't want to sit in that room today 
so I'm going to set up X11 VNC and then I am going to set up the virtual machine once we set up the virtual machine we set up sync thing
once we set up sync thing next Cloud after next Cloud image and after that we will have one more little thing set up for backup at the  
end and then we will show you how all of this works on your phone all right I just played with the cat and now we're going to set up VNC
are you excited are you excited I hope you're excited so let's get started first things first let's install X11 VLC yay now let's create
a password lovely now let's tell it to create a server I'm going to listen on Port 5920 cuz I'm weird I think I'm using display zero you
should start with zero and okay now I'm going to do VNC after installing tiger VNC on this computer I uh run yeah me VNC viewer 1 1921  
16852 5920 security types VNC and it's going to ask me for a password I put in the password that I had there okay so let's make         
ourselves a new virtual machine all right my friends are you ready for your eyes to bleed let's go so we are going to do a local        
installation again we're going to install my Ubuntu Server image you maybe thinking to yourself Louis why didn't you just make a        
duplicate of the similar image if you knew you were going to do the same thing again well I'm not very smart this should have been      
obvious by now up to 12 CPUs available I'm going to choose 11 here with more RAM because this is going to be used for doing a lot of    
transcoding with image so we're going to be taking larger videos and making proxies of them so that you could view them even if you're  
on a slow Network also image is going to be doing a lot of the machine learning stuff which is going to take up some space so I'm going 
to give this this 150 I'll just give it 100 gbes of storage I'm going to call this Android stuff any the network is this going to be the
bridge Network S as before try or install bun to server are your eyes bleeding yet if your eyes are not bleeding then that means you're 
not paying attention okay hit enter done I'm not I already did this with the mailcow installation so I'm going to speed through this a  
little bit but feel free to look in the time stamps below if you want understand my base installation here I'm not going to search for  
third party drivers for the network interface I am not going to use a static IP I'm going to use I'm not going to use a DHCP IP I'm not 
going to use Dynamic I'm going to use a static because I'm going to want to connect to this and know what I'm connecting to each time so
subnet 19216 8.5.0 24 address1 168 five do 54 oh well God I'm I'm out of it here 5.5 there is no subnet there 8.5.1 so the address of   
the server is 1 192.168 5.5 the Gateway is the pfSense router 192.168 5.1 and the name server is going to be our PFS router which is    
acting as the DNS server here which is 192.168 5.1 no need to save a domain applying changes applying changes is and done proxy address 
not needed I'm not going to care about testing my mirror I trust it now when it says use entire disc over here I am going to use the    
entire disc do not encrypt because we're putting this VM on an encrypted array already as same as before set it up as lvm because we    
want to be able to expand it later and the same thing goes here which is I I am insanely aggravated at the setup so we are going to I I 
do not want a boot partition that's 2 GB that just makes me mad just looking at it so 512m enter and also yeah I'm I wanted to use the  
entire space over here so I am going to delete the logical volume I'm going to delete the physical volume that they made so we're going 
to just delete all of this because I want to use the entire space and it's not going to let me use the entire space so delete this I'm  
going to delete that and then there is is this partition that's 97 GB that they use to make the logical volume delete that now when I   
have a free partition for me all my free space on the drive I'm going to add a partition we're not going to format this no formatting   
just yet just going to create a partition that uses up all the space create a volume group Android stuff VG volume group do not encrypt 
no point in encrypting here create and then we're going to create a logical volume there which is Android stuff volume I may mispell    
this because I can't see a damn thing create it's going to be ext4 root done continue my name my server's name name stuff my username   
password skip Ubuntu Pro install open SSH server yes we want that we want to be able to remote in and all these packages here it's going
to install it using snap which is cancer and I don't want cancer so don't use snap and now we wait and same as before while we're doing 
this that is going to have a specific Mac address so we might as well find it in our firewall and add it in okay so when we go to over  
here in the top Corner Diagnostics and ARP table it's going to bring us to the screen where we could see all the things connected I told
it 1 192.168 5.5 so now I know the MAC address so I copy that going to go over to Services DHCP server now that I don't have stuff in   
the screen you're not supposed to see I can zoom out again you go add static mapping IP address 192.168 5.5 host name Android stuff     
Android stuff scroll down save apply now that uh that IP address is going to be saved for my happy little server my happy little Android
stuff server all right I can reboot now and once that's restarted we can log in all right by the way the fact that you could see that   
the sun goes up and down I'm letting you in on a secret that very few people know outside of making videos sometimes I have a life don't
tell anybody though a lot of people think I just kind of sit in this chair like a ball and chain all day okay so first thing we're going
to do is going to ssh in to our new beautiful server it's going to do the same thing it always does and say are you sure you want to    
continue connecting which is great because that's how we keep somebody from just taking that server changing everything around and me   
not being able to know they did that so since this is a new server uh well before I get started with running pseudo appt update and all 
that stuff it would make sense if I added all the sync thing repository so which one was the sync thing reposit actually so there there 
are some things that you're going to eventually Remember by heart and then there are some things where you you're you're not going to   
remember them by heart and you it would be insane to for somebody to expect you to and one of those for me are like the repository names
and all that kind of stuff so like something like this for instance like you know somebody who expects you to remember this by heart is 
just an [ __ ] yeah like this stuff yeah yeah I mean I'm sure you're going to remember the the freaking pgp key ring stuff like no just 
no uh so some of this stuff yeah you're just sometimes copy and paste is just fine first thing we're going to do is we are going to add 
the repository to be able to download sync thing we're going to add this so that when we do apt update it's going to tell us it's going 
to give us a packages from the SN thing repository which is great going to UPG everything on the machine might as well this is a kitty  
over here and my kitty is purring good kitty who's my good kitty you're a good kitty you're a good girl you're a good kitty I know I    
haven't paid attention to you much very recently you're a good girl Blackberry was a good kitty imagine how much faster this would go if
you were compiling this on a Blackberry I love my kitty my kitty loves me there are few things that matter in life more than these      
simple truths the world is filled with trials and tribulations forced arbitration no right to repair but the kitty there something some 
good things in life except for when the kitty walks in the keyboard you cannot walk on the kitty keyboard you cannot walk on the        
keyboard kitty cuz you're going to break it because that's what you always do you stop the recording you can't do that [ __ ] no more   
okay pseudo apt install all right now we have sync thing okay so let's set this up we're going to create a file that we use to start    
this up it's a service file anytime the computer starts up it is going to start up our program now I'm going to have this start as a    
normal user there's really no reason to run sync thing as root this user account is literally just going to be for backing files on this
virtual machine so sync thing at user. service now watch what happens at the top of the file when I type user. service ready see this it
change it to Lewis anytime you use a dollar sign in the Linux command line whatever you type after it like this is not going to be word 
what uh there's a place where you could store environment variables and there's default ones so this is actually going to be something  
else this tells it look for a variable word now don't actually look at it like the word word so I'm typing that because I wanted to use 
your username and also the reason I type it for myself is it's pretty easy for me to forget my name from time to time with the amount of
sleep that I get so it makes sense my computer will remind me so here's our file description self-explanatory user this is going to     
start as our user rather than his root over here exact start we're starting Sy thing no browser means it's not going to automatically   
open the web interface when the server starts which makes sense because we are not installing this on a computer that's going to of a   
guey gooey address what this means over here is that it's going to listen for things on every interface this is important because if we 
don't set this over here I'm not going to be able to log into the web interface by default for security sync thing is set up to not     
allow people to log in from other computers their default idea is when you install this program I am going to be using it like like Sab 
and zbz you know it's it's being set up in a way where you're going to it's a web interface but you're supposed to use it on your       
computer but I want to be able to log into this guey from another computer because this is a virtual machine now this is going to be    
insecure by default because there's no username and password on this which is why we are going to put a username and password on this   
the second that this [ __ ] opens we we cannot be left without a username and a password when we put that username and password on there
at this point if somebody wants to hack into this they would have to break into my house plug into my switch figure out what IP address 
this is on then break into my user and password all so that they could change my configuration or they would have to be able to break   
into openvpn in which case they're probably hacking a bank instead of me after they do that they're going to or they'd have to get my   
username my password for my VPN my certificate file all this other stuff and get my username and you get the idea like technically it's 
more secure to only run it on your host computer but for [ __ ] sake with the configuration we're doing it the at this point if they    
have broken through all that [ __ ] then you you can have my sync thing configuration over here protect system full private T true      
there's no reason to allow this to potentially access the temporary files of other applications this this does not need to be run as    
root and have full privileges so that's that controll X and then y save modify buffer enable sync thing at lewis. service now enable is 
going to tell it to start when we boot but we still have to start it so I hit up that brings me to the terminal command I had before    
start boom now we can go over to a web browser and I can go by the IP address 1 192.168 5.5 the port is going to be 8384 allow Anonymous
usage reporting no danger sync the Adit interface is configured to allow remote access without a password we're going to change that    
immediately settings guey authentication user Lewis password I'm going to make my nice secure password use https for guy and then       
connections I'm going to disable Global Discovery now why am I disabling Global Discovery Global Discovery is a feature of sync thing   
where it's automatically going to figure out what the IP addresses of the devices that I'm connecting to one another and then once it   
automatically figures that out it's going to tell another server here are Louis's IP addresses and then after it tells the other server 
here the IP addresses it's automatically just going to connect for you so I just scan a QR code and everything just works the thing is  
we're not going to be using this on the internet the way you would traditionally do it I'm going to be connecting to my home server with
a VPN sync thing is not online this virtual machine is not going to be allowed to go online it's only going to be allowed to speak to   
computers in my local network also I've given it a static IP 192.168 5.5 it has a host name Android stuff. home arpa which means that   
I'm always going to know where this is so rather than have syn thing try and figure out where I am or who or where to find me I would   
rather just tell syn thing where to find me a I'm not dependent on somebody else's server which is the point of this to begin with and b
i in my opinion I feel more comfortable and more reliable particularly when it comes to something that's backing [ __ ] up all the time 
with me telling it where something is rather than it trying to figure it out as a data recovery person the primary reason that people   
need data recovery is not because they don't have backup Services they don't sign up for it or they don't back up it's because they do  
set up a backup service but then it just randomly stops working for some no good reason people always say I can't believe people are so 
stupid that they need your services for iCloud backup and you're the exact same type of [ __ ] that's going to be wind someday you're   
going to wind up paying $2 to $6,000 to have all your [ __ ] recovered you're going to break something something is going to go wrong   
because you were careless or you trusted some option in some piece of Open Source software to work no offense the same thing I'm sure   
that option works great i' I'd rather put the IP address and all that stuff in there myself we have Dynamic DNS we've set up this thing 
with a VPN we have set up static mappings in pfSense we have a static IP on the virtual machine all of this is done so that I always    
know exactly where this is I don't need something else to autodetect and for autod detected potentially like no so let's open up the    
sync thing application on the Android phone welcome to sync thing for Android introduction I'm not going to give you permissions for    
location I will give you permission for notifications next so it's going to generate some secure keys now be first things before I get  
started I'm just going to delete the camera folder and I will explain why later not deleting the folder on my device I'm just deleting  
it from the list of things to sync click on devices click on the plus also remember we should be connected to our VPN make sure that you
are connected to your VPN while you're doing this especially if you're not on Wi-Fi sync thing plus add device so I'm going to hit the  
little QR code and then it's going to ask if it can take pictures only this time I don't know if I should trust you now you can trust it
it's it's fine you can trust it so on the PC in the web interface you go identification click to see full identification string I never 
cease to be amazed at how fast even with really shitty picture quality QR codes pick up it it's it's amazing to me so once that's done  
we're going to type in Android should Android stuff sync things server stop autoc capitalizing mofo who told you you can autoc          
capitalize who told you huh huh I'm going to keep dynamic in there just because I'm curious to see if it's smart enough to be able to   
find me I have my doubts but let's see so it says unknown device un known okay back to my computer over here here we go if it worked to 
be clear if you're actually connected properly new device device pixel 7 Pro wants to connect add new device sure I'll add it Android   
phone Advanced these settings are fine with me now this phone I I'm going to keep it Dynamic sometimes I may be connected via my VPN    
which is in the 1 192.168 6.0 subnet because that's what we set up the VPN as sometimes may be in the 192.168 5 subnet because that is  
what I'm going to be cooking up the Wi-Fi to the Wi-Fi doesn't need to be on another subnet if particularly if I'm using Trust of       
devices address Dynamic I'll save it at that now something to keep in mind here if this server is going to have a static IP I do not    
plan on changing this ever again when I was talking about putting in your IP address into that field instead of dynamic when it comes to
the location of your sync things server I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't being crazy there because on my personal setup I don't 
use Dynamic I put my IP address in so I decided to connect to my sync thing server then disconnect the network airplane moded a couple  
of times disconnect from my VPN just to see if it would catch it again and one of the things that I see over here is that folders it    
says idle it has scanned all my stuff but when you take a look over here one of them which is the biggest folder says out of sync so    
this is out of sync and my Android phone shows up as disconnected now in the application even if I go over here and I go restart it's   
going to show up the Android stuff sync thing server as disconnected now watch what happens when I change the address over from d       
Dynamic over to what it should be I'm just going to change this and keep it uh Android stuff. home. arpa check and I believe we have to 
put the port number there which is going to be 2200 and the protocol it's using TCP So you you're going to put your url TCP hold in SL  
slash it's going to be either your IP address or your host name plus your domain name and then 22,000 so you could also do this 192.168 
5.5 colon this we edit our device and now we go back we're going to restart actually before we restart see it says devices up to date   
this is why we want to hardcode it I don't want the software trying to figure out for me what's connected to what the static IP address 
of my server has not changed it is the same IP via the VPN I'm connected to the with the exact same IP that I had before 192.168 6.2 so 
my server is at the same IP that it was before but the local Discovery didn't work now even if there is no sort of Discovery like I     
don't have Global Discovery enabled intuitively I would think maybe it's at least going to try and knock at the same address it was last
time right so if my ls's server was located at 192.168 5.5 last time let's since it's been maybe 20 minutes and he just disconnected and
reconnected let me knock in the same server again it doesn't do that which is why I would rather hardcode it using my own settings this 
is why anytime I see either Global Discovery local Discovery anything related to a network address where it says Auto I just be very    
very suspicious of that especially if you've done all the work to hardcode everything to set it up so you have a static IP for your     
server you have a static mapping for your static IP so something else can take it you have Dynamic DNS that works you're getting the    
same IP every time you get to your open VPN like if all that stuff is set up and you've already done all the work for it don't trust an 
application Auto feature to do what you've already confirmed to work manually I know I'm repeating myself there but it's very important 
because something like this that little thing over there that little thing like that would is what would cause somebody to spend $1 to  
$3,000 in data recovery at Rossman repair group like I I I am doing my best to be an anti- sponsor and keep you from ever going to a    
data recovery company okay with that we continue all right so now we're going to be adding some folders remember the first thing I said 
about deleting the camera folder the reason that I did that I had good reasoning for that you may think why you're going to sync that   
anyway is you notice when I go to pixel 7 Pro in the directories there is DCIM now inside DCIM is camera there was a customer that      
showed up that didn't realized they had a camera application installed that apparently was using a different camera folder or Chang     
their I don't know what the [ __ ] it was that happened but it was sending their photos to another camera folder inside of here their   
gallery application was only set to view the camera folder so they didn't realize that all their pictures were right there on their     
phone was just in another folder and there was a data recovery company that wanted over $800 to recover it for them recover it for them 
as the South Park Cable Company CEO would say anyway when it comes to data recover most people they do set up backup solutions that the 
customers that I get for it's not that they didn't have a backup is that they had it backed up on three drives and they all failed to   
the same time is that they thought it was syncing to iCloud but it wasn't it's not that they don't set up backups they do they just     
don't work because of random stupid [ __ ] like this that you would never in a million years anticipate so I don't want to be in some   
situation where you're taking your photos your camera app changes the [ __ ] name of the folder inside of DCIM to another folder cuz    
I've seen that before and then wind up with your photos not getting backed up and you thought they were it takes five [ __ ] seconds to 
just say I'm going to back up DCI instead of backing up camera and because I've seen applications use another folder inside of DCIM     
because they're bastards this is exactly what we're going to do so use this folder allow syn thing to access folders in DCIM yes now    
folder type send and receive send only means Android sends to the server but what I change in the server doesn't change here send and   
receive means I'm sending to the server but if I add [ __ ] on my server to that folder it'll automatically sing to my phone and receive
only means I will only receive things from the server but I will not send anything from my phone to that folder on the server so when I 
want to back things up only I hit send only but when I want to transfer back and forth I'll use send and receive so for my music I'll   
use send and receive for like audio book stuff like that send and receive documents send and receive for photos I'm never going to put  
photos on here that I want to view on my phone in that way because I'm going to be using image for that separately anyway and I'm going 
to have a library set up with image but more importantly this folder is going to be like my phone is about one almost like 1.3 terabyt  
of images I I don't have enough space on my phone for them to begin with so if I even set it up to receive everything back to my phone I
would actually fill up my phone immediately I can't do that my documents audiobooks folders all these folders together like maximum one 
or two gigs even my music folder is not going to but my my pictures and my camera that's going to be like 1.3 terabytes so if I set send
and receive here I would fill up my phone entirely and be [ __ ] so this is going to be set to send only and all the other settings are 
fine I'm not going to mess with Version Control right now Version Control and file versioning I'm going to be keeping regular backups   
here so like once a week I'm going to be doing a VM backup of everything here and I'm also going to set up another backup that's going  
to be for recent backups in case I've like uh you know there's a file that I added recently that wasn't in the VM backup with the amount
of space and stuff that I change on a regular basis like having Version Control would just be a nightmare with this if you want to read 
into that by all means I'm just not going to be going into it here so so I'm going to add documents next I'm going to add the documents 
directory and yeah that's my documents directory I'm going to set that to send and receive now remember to check your server and you    
it's not checked by default you got to check that remember what I said most customers for data recovery they set up their data recovery 
and they they set up their backups and they thought it was working that that's a thing people do that it's a regular everybody thinks   
I'm not that idot that it would happen to you know who says that the [ __ ] idiot that it would happen to every time and if you make fun
of somebody else for it I guarant if you make some fun of somebody else cuz something bad happened to them oh I guarantee that shit's   
going to happen to you that's the way life Works speaking of bad things happen to you you know what bad things will happen to you in    
your relationship life if you don't read Amir lavine's book called attached many bad things read this book it's an excellent way to     
avoid dismiss of avoiding people that's that could be its own that could be its own [ __ ] 12-h hour video that could be its own 12-h   
hour video but now is not the time it's an exceptional book I put that up there with Jim cams start with no uh John Maxwell's five      
levels of leadership and Roger Mendelson has a book The the he was a collections agent I believe and he knew all so as a collections    
agent that dealt with businesses that were failing he had all this advice for People based on his experiences and very good book Jim cam
start with no Amir lavine's attached quality books okay all right I've got the folders that I want I'm not actually I'll do recordings  
next yeah sound records that was me at the zoo send only okay now it's going to scan everything here which is going to take a while     
because I have slow slow Wi-Fi I have a garbage cheap ass Wi-Fi access point here Louis Android phone wants to share folder recordings  
add new folder yes now before we add the folder I don't want to add it here because it's going to end up in home/ Lewis that's I I want 
this to have its own path here so we're going to have Android backup slash I'm going to all these folders are going to get added to a   
folder called Android backup they're going to be subfolders of that folder same thing here also remember that I can't add the downloads 
folder it won't let me I have done my best to try and figure out how to get around that I think the only remotely close way I can get   
around that is if somehow I I've been thinking about doing the sneaky underhanded [ __ ] where I add a folder on my Android phone and   
then I somehow go through and edit a config file here and I manually type in the directory I want to type that's that's more work than I
care to do right now though just sync a folder that I don't actually use but yeah you'll get this you'll get a message if you try to    
sync your downloads folder that looks like this and new versions of Android if I go directory if I go downloads that's a douchy ass     
picture of me yes it takes a very special douchebag to not only have a douchy picture of them but [ __ ] download a douchy picture of   
them I forget what I needed that for I also think I have a flat Earth Meme here somewhere that would be funny to show you but okay      
that'll have to be for another video yeah you cannot use this folder to protect your privacy choose another folder so it won't let you  
choose the download folder which is kind of annoying but that's not the fault of sync thing that's the fault of Android if I find a way 
around that I will publish it in the written version of this guide I've never needed this but I realize if I'm doing this as a guide for
somebody else you probably have a need for it when you look over here you can see the progress they're all sinking uh it is sinking as  
fast as it can zipping the modern way as they would say so I got audio book documents movies pictures recordings and it's actually still
the reason you don't see the camera folder oh remember what I just said there remember what I just said about why people need data      
recovery look at the one folder where I didn't click the freaking button I'm telling you there's a reason I'm doing this I'm not just   
writing a guide I'm writing a guide and I'm doing this in real time so every single thing that anybody is likely to [ __ ] up you see   
there you go what did I just tell you I just gave you that lecture on data recovery and stupid careless [ __ ] that idiots like me do   
huh this is why I don't make fun of my customers see this is why I do this is misconception that the Sheep logo on my website is because
I think Apple uses a sheep I do not the Sheep is humble the Sheep is honest the Sheep is a nice kind loving creature he's humble he's   
not going to tell you $800 because you didn't click a damn checkbox it's a good little sheep okay there we go so now we are syncing all 
of our files next up now that we have file syncing done I am going to be installing an office suite that allows me to edit documents on 
the go whether on my phone or on my laptop when I connect in Via openvpn so that you don't have to use Google spreadsheets Google drive 
and everything else and this this is going to be that's actually a good thing to do while this is syncing because this is going to take 
a while and before I show you any of the tutorials for programs like image I do need to have photos that I could actually use which     
means I have to sync what's on my phone beautiful morning let's get started doing a video ow I don't know what happened like I woke up  
one day and I I can't look at this stuff anymore it just messes me up I don't know how I had these lights in my face for like eight     
years in the first three years I did YouTube videos I had no lights whatsoever because I just I just didn't like them I got used to them
but it just went away it's kind of like lactose intolerance like I had that as a kid and then it went away and then at some point like  
around 31 just drinking milk made me sick anyway so today we're going to be installing office suite software office suite software is a 
must have for a lot of people because they don't want to have to plug their phone into their computer with a USB cable to transfer their
document over or or email themselves a document somebody sent them on their phone edit it on on this computer they need it on that      
computer so they have to email it TOS again they wind up having multiple copies everywhere it's it it's annoying Google makes this easy 
you have Google Drive on your phone somebody sent you a document it automatically syncs to Google Drive you go to Google Drive you click
it it opens up in Google Docs or Google Sheets you can edit it immediately it will sync back to your phone it is it is nice it is quick 
it just works and this is why people use Microsoft 365 or Google App Suite and iCloud because this stuff works now I got the first part 
of it done which is transferring bidirectionally using sync thing which is incredibly reliable great amazing piece of software but one  
your document is on your server like what are you supposed to do ssh in there and like [ __ ] use Nano to edit your word document like  
no we're not just no so what we're going to be doing is we're going to install an office suite now that we already have our file        
transfer set up that's going to work with that folder and one of the this is going to be the worst of every video that I do just based  
on the like this is any let me introduce you to the to the uh to to the landscape of options for using uh Cloud hosted office suite     
software in Linux this this is fun so the first thing is many people are going to suggest is nexcloud nexcloud is that all-in-one office
suite that uh will change your contacts from read WR to readon so that your contacts get deleted when you update and without telling you
you have your uh your your calendar app which will say 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. in the same window you have got your your photos loader which  
works like image would work if you were running it on a clicking hard drive and accessing it via 56k modem and then you got your        
document Suite which is one of my favorite Parts in nexcloud it's the favorite feature in nexcloud so this is going to be the document  
that I am accompanying with this video that's going to have all the installation commands all the it's going to have a bunch of         
screenshots and how to set everything up it's going to really explain everything in great detail so you could follow along or if you    
just don't want to listen to my voice because some people may not want to listen to my voice it's hard to believe but you know there are
people out there that don't want to listen to me imagine that you this is going to have everything this is a standard ODT document right
here right watch what happens when I click it that the most open source sh I've seen in my life but wait wait it's better you would     
think okay listen you just didn't install the plugin right you didn't install the software or it's it's misconfigured watch what happens
when I click here it works I don't know what else to say other than these people hate you they hate you and if I told you to install    
this I would hate you too my you know my mentor always told me loish you hate nothing you intentionally dislike it and he was right do I
I dislike you at times yes but I don't hate you so I'm not going to tell you to install this it actually gets better you would think    
okay whatever it's a small UI bug I'm going to this is an Intel i7 14,700 K the know the oxidation is still fresh in the CPU I wish that
was a joke it has an mvme SSD 64 GB of RAM and this is the only VM running in my machine right now I turned all the other ones off just 
to show you this look at how slow this is technically it works but if I show you how to use this yeah I could say I showed you how to   
use open source software to replace all Microsoft Google and apple stuff but You' never use it you'd view this video and never do it    
again you go running back to suer betry begging him to suck up as much of your data as possible to sell you to advertisers because it is
it's better to have no privacy than to have no sanity and this is the this is this is the compromise you make with lot of Open Source   
software this is Google Docs and Google Drive watch this I didn't click on the window click on the window get page down oh that's       
beautiful look at that this flows right through this flows right through it's this now there are other programs available and one of    
them is called cryptpad so cryptpad is um I like the developers and like their instance that they have on on their on their website     
their Cloud instance if you pay for it it's nice stuff if you want to self host it that's again to be clear you're not pay paying at    
that point so they have no obligation to make it easy for you and they don't make it easy for you so there's a Docker container and if  
you download all their if you use their their yamama file and you download their Docker container they use the same config file for the 
one that you would want to build and install yourself versus their Docker container and one of the interesting things is is that uh the 
configuration file is set up by default to listen on Local Host rather than 0000 Z now if you're going to use something like engine X as
a reverse proxy that actually makes sense you make engine X the what is listening on and you would have the docker you would have that  
listening on on on Local Host the the problem is that you're inside a Docker container listening on Local Host which means that your    
reverse proxy which you didn't install inside the docker container because the documentation never made it sound like you had to do that
will never be able to access it so yeah after you spend 10 or 20 minutes messing with it and going through all that uh you'll you'll    
finally install it and you'll get something like this right so this is great see I got my apps I got Google I I have my my Excel I have 
my word documents everything's installed right I got a check box now watch what happens when you go to open it what do you see over here
that you don't see over here documents documents it's a mirage it's a mirage Mr Clinton wanted to play so I moved the desk a little bit 
and raised it so that I could pet him he's cute so he gets to get away with interrupting my video we're going to be installing only     
office only office is what Crypt pad uses as a back end and it's pretty good there's a couple of issues with it the first is that it's a
Minefield to install and the second I'm going to wait till the end of the video because that one I I can't spoil it just yet you you    
can't fast forward the video you got to wait that this is this is a good one so the first issue with it is the Minefield of installation
there are a bunch of different ways to install this and many of them are um don't work like some of them just functionally don't work   
and they don't tell you which one doesn't work when somebody says read the effing manual in Linux what they're actually saying is eat [ 
__ ] and die because you'll find manuals with stuff like this I know that what you mean is download the proper yml Docker compose file  
edit it to my hearts content so that and then go to the directory that has it and run the F and like run Docker compose but over here if
you're a newbie like CD link to your modified Docker compose Docker compose is a file CD is how you move to a directory it's like just  
little stuff like this that if you're a new user you're going to read this and just what and then why this is why people go back to     
Google and apple the the site has a bunch of different pages on it you do not want to install only office docs only office docs if you  
go for this one you're not actually going to be able to edit any documents even though it's called only that's the server you need the  
clients that connects to it and a lot of the stuff is really not named in a manner that is um is understandable why people if you       
install the if you go here and you install only office Docs server you'll wind up with something that allows you to edit documents if   
you set up your own client to connect to to the doc server what you need to install is the entire thing it's called workspace and that's
what you and also you're going to want the Community Edition the problem here is that there's a bunch of different ways to install it   
and a lot of them don't actually work we're going to be using the workspace install files so you get there's a one method here the      
workspace install method I'm going to include a link to that just in case this site changes and becomes more confusing than it already  
is like there's this when you click and you got so many different options here uh this one I don't recommend any again if you use the   
wrong one this is the consequence you'll wind up getting this the document cannot be saved please check connection settings or contact  
your administrator when you and it's going to show up no matter where you go and you're going to go crazy wondering what you did wrong  
but what you did wrong is you chose the wrong version installing the open source software is kind of like opening a ticking bomb where  
you you like you have to choose which wire is it is it the red one the what the yellow one the green one and if you choose the wrong    
page on their website to install the software you're going to end up with this and that's now fun so we're going to start with the in   
workspace in script it's going to be workspace install and I forget what damn tab that's in damn it is it here is it here here we go so 
we're going to W get this particular script over here let's go okay I just started my virtual machine so let's see how long it takes to 
boot you are on a nice SSD damn it there we go that's actually pretty fast so first thing I like to do is I like to make a programs     
directory to keep all this stuff I'm going to W get this script sure I don't have to type w get because they did it for me very nice of 
them look at that look at that and next up we're going to install Docker and all the things that I need in order to install Docker now  
Docker is very nice they on their website they really just give you the commands that you need to run for everything to work which is   
very nice of them so we're going to remove all the old versions of Docker first anything just in case I have anything there that I      
shouldn't have it's all gone install Docker using their installation script and they it's the docker installation instructions on their 
website are actually quite nice they give you everything that you need once that's done we're going to install Docker compose plug-in   
[Music] all right I probably installed that earlier next up we're going to add a group I'm going to add a group I'm going to add myself 
to a group so if I add myself to this group I don't have to run this as roote every time and doing that means I don't have to log out   
and log back in again but I'm so used to logging out and logging back in again that I actually just did it anyway it's it's a have it   
okay now we're going to install the version that we want so let me just programs I don't know if I already have something in here I'm   
there we go okay I'm going to download my installation script bendy stop disturbing me I got to keep starting the video God damn it all 
right I know okay once we we have the script good boy who's a good kitty and then we run it oh I forgot the little workspace command B  
worksspace install let's see if it doesn't need it- MD we're going to put a mail domain here so I'm going to put lsom server. chicken   
killer.com it's got some interesting mail features in it oh yeah pseudo and run it as pseudo install with Docker yes do not use the APT 
method you will you will regret it later just trust me just trust me it doesn't really work yeah one by the way one of the the          
consequences to installing the wrong version is this there's many different consequences so if you install the wrong ver the website is 
kind of a Minefield and it doesn't really explain things in a way that I think is newbie friendly one of them is that there's many that 
you can install that are a server but when I say server I don't mean like you connect to it and then you edit documents versus running  
it on your local computer when I say server I mean that they literally expect you to make make your own client and then you you make    
your own client that then like shows only office within it but you would have to set up the website and everything else and that's fine 
there's nothing wrong with it I appreciate that they offer it it's just the the site doesn't really make that obvious and then you got  
this if you install the wrong version you will will have this happen the document could not be saved and this will happen whether you no
matter what instance you use if you please check connection settings or contact your administrator this guy did a pretty good job on    
their Forum of of documenting it a lot of people have this issue and this really just comes down to like just install the right version 
like there's a there's a reason that this is very specific I don't want to have my guide say go to website and follow instructions to   
install the problem that I have with most instructions is the manual never explains my my issue there are many issues that I have well  
aside from software but there are many issues that I have when installing software and like the man every time I refer to the manual the
manual doesn't actually answer my question so hopefully showing you the exact page on their website and the exact script to install is  
helpful for you what do you think clinty tell them tell them clinty [Music] what do you think of Linux software manuals boy hi good one 
of the nice things here is that that script actually does do almost everything for you like I'm pretty sure if I take a look at it that 
it actually does install Docker for you let's see if you don't have it curl yeah wow install curl yeah this thing really assumes that   
you're in this is the right script it really does assume you're a newbie it's going to download everything for you whatever different   
version you have okay once that's done we can go to our web browser and go to the IP of the computer so w so again if you forgot we're  
192.168 5.5 go to our browser the portal process might take some time please wait now this is one of the ways that you'll know if you   
installed the right version you go F12 you go console and you see this so you [ __ ] up and installed the wrong version so one of the   
things that you may notice is that I ran the installation script but I didn't type anything into it remember I ran this pseudo bash     
workspace install.sh M mail server now watch this so where did I get that command or the idea to use that command I'll show you this is 
from their own documentation bash workplace D install.sh MD your domain and when you do that it literally doesn't even start what you   
have to do is you have to do it with Community next to it so what you actually need to install I did this to prove a point when some    
somebody with regards to Linux says read the manual what they're actually saying is gargle my balls they're just saying in a different  
way they're using different words but they mean the same thing the manual in Linux never actually tells you how to do the things that   
you want to do and sometimes they tell you how to do the things that you want to do but they tell you how to do it improperly manuals   
are not written by people that actually try doing or running the commands that they put there they put the commands that they think or  
they remember they kind of Imagine are there but they don't actually work through it themselves to make sure it works for normal people 
and that's why Google Apple and Microsoft win what you actually need to do is you need to type this you have to have- it workspace if   
you don't do that it won't work and it doesn't say over here that that is the case when you read the documentation nowhere in this line 
you can install all works office only office workspace components and modules at once to do that run the following commands not true so 
I'm going to restart and just erase everything and go from scratch uh so I have a script to just remove everything that is in Docker on 
my computer it's called dock Docker remove I'll show you this is helpful when I'm doing any sort of instructional thing like I have a   
nice little thing that just removes everything over here so yeah that removes all my crap so roove I forgot that there's no dash on it  
so now we're going to do it again with this command select y to install recommended and now we go through the entire process again yay  
I'm going to go stand on my balcony for a bit JWT is enabled by default the random secret is generated automatically on the information 
thank you for installing op only office you can now configure your portal and add mail server to your installation in case you ski said 
earlier using the control panel I'm going to clear everything in my browser so I don't confuse it all cache all cookies all site data   
everything going to have a fresh tab oh I'm typing in the fine box now oh I forgot you have to set it up once you're inside of it for   
https it's HTTP by default so the first thing that you do when you open it you'll get welcome to your only office portal thank you for  
choosing only office for the security reasons the password set a procedure must be performed remember when I told you that the uh office
software landscape on Linux is hopelessly [ __ ] with one of the wrong versions you get that error if you install the other wrong       
version you'll get that error every time you try to open a document and the documentation on their website doesn't tell you that if you 
install it this way it's not going to work if you just copy and paste from their own documentation you can install only office workspace
components and modules at once nowhere does it say here that it's not actually going to work and when and the way that you would figure 
out that that's here's the other thing it says this may take a while so if you're not Advanced enough to know to hit F12 in your browser
and then go over to console to figure out if it's really loading or not then it's not actually you may actually let it sit there for 10 
minutes and waste time out of your life that wondering why it never loaded thinking that something's wrong with your computer when      
something's actually wrong with that software and that's what we're going to try to do with this entire video we're like taking all this
I'm like [ __ ] beating the Linux out of it like we are beating the open source out of this as much as we can because if you don't beat 
the open sord if you don't if you don't like you know you got to slap Linux around a little bit you know if you don't slap Lin it's kind
of like a bully if you don't hit the bully back he'll hit you and he'll destroy you it's a bully like this it's all a club and you're   
not in it I don't I don't know how else to say if I tell you go to only office's site and install this I will write the same crappy     
guide that everybody else writes because when I installed this a long time ago it just worked I can't assume anything open- Source      
software like can very easily lead you to a closed padded room like what again it's just like this [ __ ] like it'll this kind of stuff 
it it's going to make you question your sanity you're literally copying pasting the commands from the documentation it's not your fault 
fault and the worst part of all of this is that if you are in advanced enough to click F12 in your browser and go over to console you   
would think it's you because when you first start up this program it doesn't say anything other than please wait this may take a while  
so it's literally gaslighting you into thinking that you should be sitting there waiting for 5 or 10 minutes when you're waiting for    
nothing because it's never going to load and if you install the other version improperly from their site then you'll wind up with that  
error every time you open a document the reason that I'm going through every single thing step by step is because I understand Linux I  
know that just because it worked for me 20 minutes ago doesn't mean it'll still work today and like when I installed only office on my  
setup in my virtual machines for the first time I didn't have this issue for me to write this guide and do it properly and anticipate   
every single little thing that's going to cause you to give up and go back to close to a software I need to go through it myself and    
ensure that every single thing works so and in my guide I'm going to tell you to use the proper command I'm not going to tell you to use
the command that's going to [ __ ] with you cuz if I copy and paste from the documentation you will end up with software that doesn't   
work and you will want to scream and it's just it's just bad so once you're in there we're going to set up everything you're going to   
put a password you going agree to the terms of the license oh my God why are you autoc comp completing all this stuff for me I don't    
want to auto complete ls. demo Rosman group.com I hit continue and here we go are you ready for the open sourc SYM that I'm about to    
show you are you ready all right we're going to go to documents now it gives you sample documents that you can open I'll open a sample  
document because I installed the right version it actually opens now I want to open a document that's on my computer where where do I go
uh shared with me favorites recent private room common in projects invite user to portal maybe I go to the settings right now let's go  
to the settings administrator profile settings here we go settings up here control panel storage here we go maybe I can add a local     
directory connect storage for static oh we got local storage that's beautiful but the connect button doesn't work surely there's        
something here that allows me to get access to files on my server so I I want to run this as a server and I want to be able to access   
the documents that are on it you can't no really you you literally can't it's it's not a feature in order to open a document document   
server you must pass the direct URL to the document you you can't open files in your computer now I I actually messed with this because 
I thought there's no [ __ ] way no [ __ ] way can I not actually open documents so I really went down the rabbit hole with this and I   
want to show you how far I went down to figure out that this uh this is not this is not something that's doable so when you go over to  
workplace install I'm just going to check out the scripts that I downloaded this is workplace install that we ran and I I wanted to     
search for what it's doing so one of the things I noticed is the word Docker really doesn't show up here but it's doing all this Docker 
stuff from scratch it's it only shows up to ask if I want to install using Docker which means that it's probably not inside this script 
it's probably in a script that's somewhere else so when you go through the entire thing you'll see that there is a URL to grab another  
script and so when you choose install with Docker you will eventually get to here we go so install script so when you hit yes it brings 
you to this so let's grab this script over here so I'm just going to copy and paste no now the first thing that I did the first time I  
went for this is I went to the not I went to the directory that this is installed in and I just kind of explored around a little bit so 
let's see the into only office we have document server control panel Community server MySQL setup mail server let's go to document      
server huh okay what do you have here we have a data directory okay LS data h what do we have here data we have fonts forgotten logs all
right so here's what I'm here's what I'm going to do watch this I so now somebody's going to think Lewis okay you can't do it inside the
program they don't let you do that but surely you could mount it as a volume don't you know how to use Docker you [ __ ] okay well I'll 
watch this just watch it's GNA programs I'm going to show you the method that I use for this so you do this now now usually when you're 
dealing with Docker and volumes sometimes they say that the permission should be read write so I'm going to start searching this with a 
colon RW and when you do that you find this where they're specifying all the docker volumes this may look similar to a Docker compos yml
file that you're used to and one of the things that you see here is this is obviously where it's specifying files I mean this is        
obviously where it's specifying where where data is being stored that that's what this is for so I tried doing this I literally I       
actually added an argument for my directory I like you know home Lewis documents and I tried mounting it in almost every single         
different location but the problem isn't that the volume is not mounted the problem is that this was never implemented as a feature in  
this software because they never thought that a document server would want to be able to access the files on that server but again      
what's the purpose of this video to [ __ ] beat the Linux out it we got to and here's the thing there's a way to beat the open source   
out of this we are not going to let the [ __ ] Linux win so let me show you what we're going to do so there's ways to actually get files
into this thing but we you got to fight a little bit it's not going to be easy you got to fight for your right to use open source       
software so when you go back here we go to settings connect okay let's just click around like a madman because surely there's a way to  
do this surely there's a way to do this right connected clouds oh can I connect a third third party Cloud okay we have next Cloud [ __ ]
that these are all other people's services and I I don't want to install you know I don't want to install entirely other platform web   
dev and this is do you I took a break to have some food got some nice pesto sauce this is a bad time for me to eat because this part of 
the video is going to actually make me nauseous I told you that I was going to show you the most liny [ __ ] in the world and this is   
going to take the cake right here so this is Cloud Server software the whole idea is that I should be able to edit my documents in the  
cloud so regardless of the computer that I'm on I have my files in the cloud but I can't my My Cloud Server software cannot read the    
files from my Cloud Server computer and if I decide to mount those directories within the docker volume it still won't work because they
didn't make the software so that it could see like it wasn't even designed to be able to see items in its own document data directory   
but this this [ __ ] actually gets better there so there's a webdb server that's a kind of a light web dab server it's not like         
installing Apache or engine X and setting some large thing up because I I like I'm not doing that that's that's like buying a forklift  
to bring my groceries upstairs it's just ridiculous I can't I can't bring myself to do that so there's this nice little Python program  
called whsy dab it's a it's a web dab server that's very small and works decently and so there there's there's a couple of funny things 
about the software though so let's say that I want to have two different directories my documents directory and my Android backup       
directory show up in my uh if let's say I want to have both of those directory show up in my like folder I I can't do that I can't map  
Android backup to webdav Android backup and then map let's say uh documents to webdav documents the way that you can in a Docker        
container that that doesn't work because you can only log into one at a time I can imagine a Docker volume like let's say you had five  
different directories in one Docker volume imagine only being able to use one at a time and having to log in differently each time but  
now you may think well lisis that's an easy solution all you do is you create a new directory and you Sim link all the directories you  
want to look at into that directory white what are you even bitching about see this over here and the documentation for the software the
documentation for the software has an option called follow Sim link it's going to be F follow Sim links and you can set it the true so  
we're done right no we're not because that option doesn't work that option doesn't work unless you install a different version of the   
software because the version that you get on pip doesn't work which means it will Gaslight the [ __ ] out of you and thinking you will  
pull your hair out wondering if you got if you set up your sings Right like the same way that like it's like you have you have a follow 
Sim link option that doesn't work you have an option to install the document server and it's not there it's Linux everything is a [ __ ]
Mirage it's like what the Frank said when he's like true facts about the Frog it's like that is how a frog do this is how a Linux do or 
the way Ralph cramden put it in The Honeymooners when he was talking about his mother-in-law he doesn't mean to be mean just born that  
way Linux doesn't mean to be a joke it was just born that way so let's set up our cluster [ __ ] so we're going to be setting up a a a a
a a webdav server so that my program running on my local computer can read files off my local computer so let's get started I'm going to
be installing python on my computer so that I can install a webdav server so that I can configure it to work with Pam so that my local  
users on my Linux computer can log into my webdb server so I'm not using Plaine text and then creating Sim links so that I can start a  
server that reads my files from my other server all right it's going to be worth it you'll see when you see how fast this loads it's    
going to be worth it every single little detail is going to be covered so that you can reproduce this yourself because I don't want you 
to go through any of this while you're trying to do it I want you to have the fastest experience as easily as possible and hope them    
let's let's see if we can accomplish that so first thing I got to do is install python python Li 3 Dev lib SSL Dev and we're also going 
to install Pam gev because I am going to be uh using this webdav I keep saying calev I'm going to be using this webdav server with local
users I'm not going to have it like I'm not going to have plain text files for login we're not doing that it's going to be using the the
system usernames and passwords that are stored for our Linux users which is going to be way more secure than like that other [ __ ] so  
let's go let's go after this we're going to install some we're going to install a sh Root 6 and python Pam python Pam say python Pam    
three times really fast python Pam pyth now the reason I'm doing it as root is because I'm going to be using I'm accessing Pam with it  
so like usually don't install that stuff is rote but Pam it complains okay we're going to make a directory if I haven't made it already 
Okay let's make our SSL certificate because I mean like if we're going to be this smooth brand like yes why not create an https         
connection from my local computer to my local computer go right yeah let's HTTP assets that we look like that that's definitely a       
priority on that ARA okay let's make a configuration file now all right let's make our configuration file so let's go over what this is 
going a I made it docin yl I can change that later so this is going to may be listening on my main interface now I know that I'm        
connecting from Local Host so I don't really need to do that but it is in a Docker container so Docker container seeing Local Host is   
going to be different than actual local host I could set this up on a Docker network but at the point that I go into Docker Network     
configurations to be able to make webdav work so I can see files on my own computer I will jump off my balcony this Absol like no I'm   
not this is not supposed to be that complicated [ __ ] that this is going to work on Port 8880 we are enabling https because again why  
not use https when we're doing a local connection to our local server to be able to serve files to oursel uh we have follow siming true 
but we're using the version that actually listens to follow siming true rather than the version that doesn't listen to follow siming    
true we have H over here this is going to be using the local users on our computer and uh I'm just going to set this up so that webdav  
goes to webdav root which is going to have my sim links in it for all of for all of the the F the directories that that I want so and oh
I also have to show you how to properly make a Sim link as well because I don't think I did that and I also believe that I may not have 
installed the this let me just make sure I did that did I install [Music] whsy okay I did let's whsy Dev V okay yeah that is the new    
version okay so uh next up I have to show you how to properly make your Sim links because this is not going to work if you don't make   
your Sim links properly so I'm going to show you two different ways of making Sim links and one is going to be right and one is going to
be wrong so let's go over making assembling properly we're going to make our directory webdav root okay now if you make your Sim link   
let's I was going to show you there's two different ways to make your siming you can do ln- s now usually you put the thing you want to 
have a shortcut from and then you put where you want the shortcut to be so let's say webdav rout right now if I do that and you're going
to see in webdav root it's going to show up red pay attention to this because it's going to be important now let's say that I do the    
entire path rather than be lazy let's say that I do home Le Android backup to webdav rout you're going to see that one is blue now uh   
now if I'm just using my shell it doesn't really if I'm just using my shell it doesn't matter so let's say I go to webdav root LS       
documents it's going to see my files you're not going to see if you do that you're not going to see [ __ ] you're like it's not going to
work you need to make your Sim link with the entire path so ignore this don't do this this what you're going to do is this LNS home leis
documents home Lewis documents webdav rout oh no home Lewis webdav rout right now you're going to do it again with Android backup so    
every folder that you want this to be able to see you're going to put here now when you do that you can do LS documents and you'll see [
__ ] so don't be lazy when you make your Sim link or else it's not going to do what we need it to do so we've made uh did we make our   
SSL file oh yeah we did we did next up we are going to be creating a system Des service so that this starts up every single time we     
start the computer uh because this way we never have to [ __ ] think about this again because never in a million years would I imagine  
that I have to start a webdav server to see my local files this way I do not go I wouldn't this is what I did on my server so that I    
would not go into a [ __ ] boot loop every single time I booted torturing myself cuz like who the [ __ ] would ever imagine you have to 
do this so this is going to set it to run as me but I don't want to do that because I'm using Pam so that's probably going to be        
aggravating and that's not gonna yeah I can't be Pam so enable whiz gdav with after that okay let's see if it started let's see this is 
where I see if I [ __ ] something up usually I have [ __ ] some wait I did the wrong service t s the um what I [ __ ] something up I    
always wait did I D yeah [ __ ] something I was looking at the time stamp okay let's see what I did so let's just stop the service      
there's likely something I did that was really stupid that's that's usual config act whsg daav oh okay yeah I I never changed the config
file back I'm a [ __ ] one yeah so I I made it as a docon rather than a yaml okay that was stupid now I'm going to make sure that my    
documentation that I'm writing for you guys has the right stuff in it I am doing all of this stuff as I go because I want to double     
check that every single thing I'm providing for you actually works if there is an error in all the documentation that I've written that 
I'm providing you then I will see it because I'm doing it all off of my document so I wrote this thing before doing this video just to  
make sure that what I was providing you would actually work so this is kind of like a test run of my own documentation okay now now I'm 
just going to see if that works uh config act whis gdav wis. yo and it listens more okay now we're going to see if this works I don't   
mean this software is a piece of [ __ ] I'm just frustrated at the situation act okay so kadaver this is my other computer so I'm going 
to try to connect to it from here https 8080 webdav rout untrusted certificate that's fine bro okay I made that certificate I pulled it 
out of my ass so now we're going to see if it works with my system user couldn't open collection okay I mounted it to webdav my bad yeah
s so in the configuration file I made it webdav it's in my home folder that it's web da Roo okay that's stupid now see I can LS I can LS
documents and I can LS Android backup and I see stuff I purposely deleted all the stuff that I synced because I'm going to do it again  
as you can see it's all there now it's just all there now I'm going to put a file there that's very going to be very large it's going to
be that same file that was [ __ ] everything up earlier that giant pfSense manual doc so I'm going to put it in the main folder the     
Android backup folder and the documents folder as a test and this is going to be the fun part because you're going to see that this is  
completely worth all the aggravation well my aggravation not your aggravation but wait till this is going to be good okay so we go back 
to our only office setup connection URL https 192.168 5.5 port 8080 webdav uh we are going to put the credentials in for my user Make   
shared we're going to call it folder is going to be local storage save and now it's connected so this is pfSense video uh you can click 
access I can change access stuff for it Android backup it's right there and documents folder okay it's a little open sourcy on the      
documents folder uh but why watch what happens when I open this file so I'm going to put this right next to my next Cloud instance and  
my uh Google in let's get an idea of how these all perform so I'm going to open up this document in Google I think that may actually    
have pasted in wrong so I'm going to repaste it into Google so we can be fair I'm going to open this up in nextcloud and I'm going to   
open it up in only office so that we can see the difference between all three so I'm going to convert this save the file copy in the    
original form ad we go come on you can do it good little program we are going to give it access for editing okay already has that so I  
can type okay so we're gonna scroll through this I'm going hit page down look at this page up page down page up page down and then I'm  
going to scroll all like let me just do this so see how it Scrolls from all the way from the top to all the way to the bottom and I can 
slide and this also has images in it and also those are PNG files that are like 2 megabytes each because I'm a [ __ ] that didn't       
actually compress them before putting it in here even though they're like this small uh now let's go over PF I mean not PF let's go over
nextcloud now nextcloud if you notice uh this actually doesn't have the images in it and it's like that that's two seconds to load      
actually it didn't even load it loaded a frame so it's that's a reference to an image I think that doesn't exist but even though it's   
loading empty [ __ ] this loads text at a quarter of the speed that only office loads images okay how this is like three seconds right  
now 4 seconds 5 Seconds six oh oh that's not fair that was a blank page okay it's kind of being a dick there let's okay let's uh you go 
up here now it's getting a little bit faster let's go back up to page up and down let's go with the buttons again yeah this is like a 1 
second lag every now and then okay so I go up here let's see how find Works we're going to find and page the server has been            
disconnected okay we give up now and Google let's just paste it in there because it's actually not in there it's going to take a few    
seconds to paste in there here we go now Google scrolling is a little bit smoother but the speed for me is the same like it just it does
look nicer than only office but functionally speaking I think that they're both about there yeah like see you scroll I mean you you can 
drag it back and forth now to be fair to see this doesn't this doesn't have images in it so it's going to be faster as a result like    
this yeah this one Google Docs doesn't have any images in this one but this one only the only office one it's still pretty good okay    
that's an empty page yeah I gotta why the [ __ ] do I have empty pages in this this needs editing badly needs editing any but as you    
scroll through it's it's it's literally instant okay when you go when it goes like 15 or 20 Pages it stops for about 100 milliseconds so
that is minorly slower than Google but this is infinitely faster than nextcloud and it's free and it's open source and it works great so
now you have the ability to open all of your documents your Excel spreadsheets your PowerPoint presentations and you're able to open all
of this stuff from a piece of software that doesn't cost any money I I would suggest paying something for it maybe they you know they   
could use the money to fix the [ __ ] file thing let's actually see if I can copy in my presentation that I did on board repair if      
that's still this is a really old one this is almost this document is almost completely Ely irrelevant now I made this like 11 years ago
MacBook board troubleshooting guide for beginners can I copy and paste the whole thing I don't think that's going to be possible so I'm 
going to download a copy let's make it a you know let's make it a power let's make it proprietary I want to see how good this is we're  
going to we're going to mess with it a little bit upload upload files make sure you can't see what I have in my computer people will be 
able to see that I listen to Sabrina Carpenter [ __ ] too late did I say that out loud okay Ros and repair training manual and we'll go 
back and forth and compare Google to this one let's compare the two instances once I get them next to each other okay so this is the    
Google one on screen and this is only office wait a second that's not it this is it okay I have too much crap open Instant it's just    
instant okay let's do a little comparison so I uploaded this to nextcloud I forgot I can't click on a file here you're not allowed to   
nextcloud doesn't allow you edit nextcloud office okay as you can see we already got this [ __ ] loading [ __ ] on the screen over here 
uh it's not horrible but it does lag like it's usable it's usable but it lags if we try Googles Google of course is going to be         
immediate the moment I click here I can measure I mean I can I can scroll up and down there's a nice little scroll bar over here        
actually can I oh I can't see a scroll bar on Google's okay next Cloud let's see how the scroll bar works I believe there's a scroll bar
somewhere here huh okay know scroll bar yes no okay here we go so only office has a scroll bar so I can do that it's not as smooth as   
Google's but it is considerably smoother than the next clouds you see there's no loading time like I can go up it's load okay the       
sidebar is not loading them until you take your finger off the key that's a that's a not implemented thing it's not a lag thing but over
here every single one of those cards loads instantly and I'm going through over 150 slides and there's no lag like the moment I stop on 
a slide I can immediately edit it here now this works there's one feature that I think is very important to go over which is the        
difference between having your email done this way versus just using the cloud interface in macow so in mailcow if I have an email like 
this and let's say I have this paper here and why I think they car is a hipster that we shouldn't be learning about if you hit view     
attachment when you hit view attachment it it it downloads the ODT document file in Firefox I like macow and I like the fact that it is 
an IMAP nice little email web interface over here for it but the problem with it is that I can't open things in the web interface       
mailcow is still in my opinion the best way to do mail if you want to do self-managed mail so because mailcow gives you the freedom to  
use whoever you want we can now use something like only office for control of our mail now why am I going to choose only office for     
control of my mail that wait till you see this so first thing I need to do is I need to fix the fact that there's no https on here I    
mean I have https in the [ __ ] webdb server and not in my actual front end that's just kind of insane so when you go to uh to this     
you're going to let me just make sure I didn't click through that too fast so you didn't see what I was doing all right so from the     
homepage you click on the settings at the top from settings you go to the left and you go to control panel after that at the top left   
https and this is going to generate you an https certificate if you have the machine open to the internet it will create create a       
properly signed certificate and if you have the machine closed off like I do it will create a self- sign certificate it does that for   
you automatically demonstrating that whoever created this particular part of the program was but once this is done where you're going to
go to the homepage here we go look at that self sign Beauty right there I love it you're can to click ma don't do this until you have   
htps setup or it's going to give you annoying errors hit add new account don't enter anything you have to click Advanced and you're     
going to put in the information remember we're not going to be using the external IP addresses here because this is on the local network
so you're going to put in the the details for your mail server as you configured it at this point if you've already if you're this far  
on the video it means that you've watched and set up self-hosted mail and at that point if you got through that miserable [ __ ] show   
you don't need me to show you how to log into your email over here but you can also use this to log into your email outside of this so  
if your email is hosted by somebody else you can still use this this is simply going to be a front end to your email and the reason why 
I like this so much is because I get to open documents right inside here so one of the things I said is that I need to show you how to  
have an experience that's as good if not better than what you get with apple Google and everybody else and what makes this a great      
experience is that when there's a document over here I'm going to be able to open that document right inside the window and start       
editing immediately and have it on a server that I can access from my other computers just like that so watch so again over here my     
default habit would be okay well yeah it's self-hosted and the email works right but when I click on this button I have download or open
and when you hit view attachment it's not opening up in this nice beautiful thing like Google Docs is in your web browser it's going to 
just download it which means I'm going to probably have this bad etiquette and habit of editing things locally and after I edit it      
locally I'm probably not going to have a change in the server and I may have the three copies of this document everywhere there's a     
reason that all this Cloud [ __ ] wins it's because it makes life easy for people that otherwise would would uh would be as disorganized
as me so what this does I can go back and I can open my email right within only office so I click mail I'm just going to search for     
something without having my entire email on the screen here we go so like something like this click this and watch how fast that is the 
email loaded instantly none of that slow nextcloud [ __ ] and when I click on this document it opens immediately this is an ODT file you
can scroll through everything beautifully and you can even see my commentary on dear being a hipster and my MLA citations for this      
philosophy paper that included The Honeymooners I I don't know they car [ __ ] me up I don't know what to say in this case they car find
himself in a situation best expressed in the first episode of The Honeymooners heads I win tails you lose I really went in on him the   
whole idea that the mind is separate from the body and all this because the one is is a distinct quantity and the other can have        
multiple like are you serious voltage gated sodium channels and neurons exist in the brain regulat mind thoughts check if you take Lil  
you'll have less seizures check thinking is a function of the Mind check if there's a quantity that can be lessen and then follows that 
there was at some time a distinct quantity check if there's a distinct quantity can be have check and if you can inhibit voltage gadium 
sodium channels and neurons then that means there's a distin quantity of them and if there's a distin quantity of them they can be haved
I'll take Ben shindo over dear dear is the 17th century AR archetype of the Williamsburg Brooklyn Hipster that says his live vinyl      
version of the album is cooler than the version I bought off of eBay because it's old older and more obscure I'm convinced he is making 
things up to sound cool to impress girls at parties and we've all been Hood wied into reading it 400 years later and being told it's    
insightful men did this to get laid yet today and they likely did it 400 years ago I can only imagine him at a wine party walking up to 
single young Buzz social lights going hey baby I think therefore I am while raising his eyebrows tell them that their mind is separate  
from their body and a cheap attempt to separate their body from their dress it works for the Hipster why not for him God bless this     
professor for not just immediately failing me like goddamn anyway I I I just couldn't like just it [ __ ] me up reading this [ __ ]     
knowing that he was do like knowing that all these dudes were doing this just to get [ __ ] which is fine like by all means do that to  
get [ __ ] just don't make me do home don't make me do homework on a 400 years later going going back back to the point of this [ __ ]  
matter so let's I have this document I opened it up now instead of having to save it to my computer and mess with it and then like have 
three or 10 separate copies of my files I can do the exact same thing that you can do in Google in Google I like having the ability to  
just click it and it immediately opens in my in my browser and I can immed start editing if you want to start editing you go file save  
copy as docx it'll convert it for you if we click over here on common you'll even see the local storage that we set up with that [ __ ] 
webdb hack so I can have it show up on all of my computers so if I can not only have a copy of it in here if I want I can have a copy   
that is located within my only office instance or I can have that show up on my sync thing backup so then it'll always go to my Android 
phone if I have all my computers where I edit documents on over here then I can have it always go over here Isn't that cool look at that
[ __ ] now I can start editing it she was a good support but like see it's instant everything just loads immediately and the reason that
this is so important is because you need to have a better experience with the open source solution than you would with the close Source 
solution if your experience with this is not equal or better you will go back to the closed Source solution that abuses you and why     
wouldn't you we want good experiences there's free as in free free beer free as in open source and then there free as in free time and  
free as in free time is in my opinion the most important Freedom which is why when this guide is done it is going to show you how to do 
all of this [ __ ] properly this is annoying to set up because you have to set up several different services but I'm hoping that by     
putting this all into one cohesive manual that you can directly copy and paste from that with all the details there for you that the    
difference in aggravation from setting up next Cloud versus setting up this is not really going to matter anymore because it's all there
for you so you have the benefit of the high performance solution without any of the downside or aggravation of having a [ __ ] with all 
this [ __ ] to figure out what works and what doesn't with that being said we're going to be moving on from the office weite part of    
this video I hope this helped you out and let's move on to the rest of it next up I'm going to be setting up a system for notes I used  
to use Google keep and I like Google keep it had what I found to be a pleasant user interface and because I found it to be a pleasant   
user interface I continued using it for a long period of time it looks like this so you have notes but you also have these Post-It note 
looking things so it's not just that you have a list shut the [ __ ] up until I'm done with the video huh like you didn't just you don't
get [ __ ] three cans of food every day so you wind up with an interface that looks like [ __ ] cat you wind up with an interface that  
looks like this which I like it you can view all your notes in a list format or you can see them as posted notes so what I'm going to be
using for notes is nextcloud um yeah I know you wanted me to use Joplin or something like that is Joplin better programmed absolutely is
nexcloud a complete piece of [ __ ] yes it is but there is one thing that I trust this thing for Post-it notes in plain text like that's
that's all I trust it for I like the ability to group notes I like the way the guey works I like the way the Android app works it's very
very simplistic which is what I want with a Notes app I don't want a bunch of different functions and features and settings and         
everything like that and for me it was just easier to figure out how to get this type of configuration and it just look like this if I  
wanted it to then it was in Joplin in Joplin you can install desktop app but I want it to work just in my browser when I click a little 
bookmark and I you can have your notes and you can have your different notebooks I don't want no I just want categories and I want to be
able to see the stuff like this so I I use it because it's similar to what I'm used to and it works um does do nextcloud do I trust it  
for contacts calendar email office photos backup no notes for Post-it notes I trust it so we're going to get get started on that so     
there are three ways that you can install this a you can install the Boomer way where you're going to install every single application  
dependency Maria DB your version of reddis your Apache whatever the hell you want to do and then keep up with all the dependencies and  
which version of PHP is not compatible with the other version of PHP [ __ ] that we can install it via snap [ __ ] that or we can       
install it via Docker we'll we'll install it via Docker now the docker method is a little bit of a pain in the ass if you want it to    
work without a a fully qualified domain name there are a lot of instructions on how to install an AO image where is going to ask you for
a fully qualified domain name and this is similar to the only office documentation where it's really really easy to follow the          
instructions and have something that doesn't work this may surprise you but that is a thing on Linux and the one of the things that's   
going to be Troublesome here is that when you read the nextcloud documentation they're expecting you to have a fully qualified domain   
name AKA you know ls's next cloud.com kind of thing which which we're not going to have this is not open to the public we are contacting
this by going to 192.168 5.5 when we are connected to our VPN or on our Lan so I'm going to show you a setup that has worked for me on  
my other system back when I actually used nextcloud which again at this point in time is literally posted notes and we're going to get  
started so first things first let's bring up the terminal on the screen I'm going to wait what what am I using Su I have in mind I'm    
going to make a directory for nextcloud downloads programs next Cloud uh go into it and we're going to make make a Nano Nano compos file
oh my God I'm losing my mind you're going to make a Docker compos file looks like this so we this is pretty much a template from one of 
their pieces of documentation I change the port it's not going to listen on 880 since I think I have something else listening on 8080 on
here I made it 8089 so what this means is that Port 80 inside the container is going to be 8089 on the host computer so this means that 
if I am if I have a web server that is listening on 000000 rather than 1270 one that means that I will be able to see it on Port 8089 in
my web browser which is which is what I want here cuz I believe 80 is being used by only office which is on the same stream and when you
do this I'll include this Docker compos file in the guide and Clinton no okay so we're going to Docker compose up- d the- d is going to 
be what keeps it running even after I close my window usually I would like to see what shows up Onre screen in case as an error but in  
this case I don't because whether or not this works or not as soon as this is as soon as this is done pulling I'm going to feed my cat  
so if it works great if it doesn't then I'm ending the evening next to my kitty cat watching an episode of Black Mirror and going to    
sleep somebody's teasing the cat so I think somebody likes keeping the cat hungry so that the kitty will show more affection otherwise I
F him I don't he's saying otherwise he's saying the [ __ ] [ __ ] you haven't I'm in a chair okay so now this part is done so let's     
visit it in a web browser why do I have pocket turned on I I can't stand that right so we're going to go to 8089 I think is what I said 
for is that the port I said actually oh here we go that is the port I said it just took so long to load that I forgot if that was the   
port I said because we're do it using nextcloud so create admin account we're going to make LS know we're going to make admin yeah [ __ 
] yeah admin make that the admin password look at that secure password for this disposable install that I'm getting rid of before I     
publish my guide right you can to remind me right ah this is all getting unplugged and erased now as you can see this is what I call    
zipping the Modern Way no really like this is this is an I74 700k 64 gigs of RAM NVM SD okay recommended apps we're not using this we're
not using this and not literally nothing but notes this is the only thing that I trust this for for obvious reasons because it's a      
steaming piece of [ __ ] but I guess notes good it does notes right I like the Notes application I like the notes app I should have to  
edit that out this is not the one using the 14 1700k okay so we have a dashboard now notice there that it was completely dark until I   
clicked it why why I didn't make anything obvious all right so once we're in here you click notes and you have notes you click new notes
to make a note I can say you could search through all your notes let's just take a new note and I'm going to say hello how are you it's 
going to make the note uh usually the title will change to what I made it sometimes it doesn't because it's it's nextcloud um Docker    
compose top DD I can also I can make categories for them change category let's make a category test notes and then when you do that     
it'll make a category for them and what I like about this we are going to check mobile app next name Docker note all right so on my     
phone I would do something like this I'm going to go over to notes when you go to notes it's going to ask you to choose an account but I
don't have an account because I'm not logged in so I go 192.168 5.5 now it's asking for an https address but I don't have an https      
address I have standard HTTP it's not encrypted right now do that says malformed server configuration because we're also not using a    
standard Port I have to tell it to use my weird ass Port yo Clint you [ __ ] [ __ ] security warning if you are not trying to set up a  
new device or app blah blah blah and I type admin which obviously you're not going to use admin you're going to make your own account   
for yourself currently logged in as admin Grant this access to your account and there you go my notes show up over there and I can also 
change the view of it let's see all notes are you serious how about you so when you go to the three things up there you go settings you 
can switch back and forth between grid View and list view so this is basic list View and sometimes I like to use grid view as well and  
this app is very very simply you just make a note over here I can say hello Mr Clinton I [ __ ] hear you and over there and then I go   
over to my computer over here and if I just hit refresh actually I didn't even have to hit refresh hello Mr Clinton I can [ __ ] hear   
you it's very simple it's very easy to see on my notes it's not the best engineered program it is not even what I would say is a good   
engineered program but it works and it's highly simple and that's what I care about again if you want something that is better          
engineered than this that is done with better programmers use Joplin it's it's infinitely better I use nexcloud because the interface is
one that I am used to that I like and again just just because the uh the performance penalty that I get from using nextcloud and the    
stupid mistake penalty I don't need the notes to tell time I don't need the notes to be fast I don't need thumbnails for my notes       
because I have such low requirements for this I'm willing to accept the fact that the software itself sucks in exchange for the fact    
that it is what I am used to I have tried Joplin and it's just one of those things where I have to get used to it and because this      
already works I use this but that that's how I would do notes and this gives me the setup that I would have with Google keep I would    
show you a much more detailed setup in this but that would require going through all of my personal notes and I just started looking at 
them to see if there's even like three of these that I'd feel good going on showing on screen and no like I I out of hundreds and       
hundreds of noes I can't even find three or four that are clumped together that I would feel okay showing on screen so that's that for  
this section of the video now if you want this to go over https what you could do is you could set up a reverse proxy using ngx the     
exact nin X ngx how did the kids say it these days how would you say it I don't know what the H kid I'm closer to Boomer than anything  
else I'm already pass Boomer if you want reverse proxy so that you're using https you could do exactly what I did when I was showing you
how to set up frig with password authentication just cancel out the password authentication section of that portion of the manual       
because with that we were adding https and SSL certificates to frigate when we're doing that I am going to be connecting to this when my
VPN is on so because I'm connecting when my VPN is on I don't care I'm not forwarding ports for this thing anyway and no port on my     
browser is ever getting forwarded for this so I'm okay using it without https if you are not then by all means use engine to set up the 
reverse proxy and again that's telling you to look up some other weird documentation I'm telling you to utilize the documentation that  
is in this manual that you already followed at this point so that frig your camera software would have https certificates all you have  
to do is get rid of the part with username password authentication because nexcloud already has username and password authentication    
hope you learned something and I'll see you in the next section
