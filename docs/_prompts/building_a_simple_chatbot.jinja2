You are a technical writer. Your task is to generate a tutorial file named `building_a_simple_chatbot.md` for the `conduit` Python library, based on the provided project code.

## Instructions

1.  Write a step-by-step, narrative guide on how to create a multi-turn chatbot.
2.  Show the necessary imports (e.g., from `conduit.chat` or `conduit.message`).
3.  Demonstrate how to initialize the chat object.
4.  Show how to send a first message and get a response.
5.  Crucially, show how to send a *second* message that relies on the context of the first, proving the chat has state or history.
6.  Conclude with a single, complete code block containing the full example.

## Style Guidelines

  - **Do not** use the first person ("I", "we").
  - **Do not** use icons or emojis.
  - **Do not** use lofty, breathless, or promotional language. The tone should be direct, factual, and accessible.
  - **Do not** add sections for licenses, contributions, or any meta-badges (like PyPI version or build status). Focus only on the user's task.
